<p class="noi title">TOM FAIRFIELD’S
HUNTING TRIP</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>THE BIG SNOWBALL</small></h2>


<p>“Well, Tom, it sure is a dandy plan!”</p>

<p>“That’s right! A hunting trip to the Adirondacks
will just suit me!”</p>

<p>“And we couldn’t have better weather than
this, nor a better time than the coming holiday
season.”</p>

<p>Three lads, who had made the above remarks,
came to a whirling stop on their shining, nickeled
skates and gathered in a small ring about the
fourth member of the little party, Tom Fairfield
by name. Tom listened to what was said, and
remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, fellows, I’m glad you like my plan.
Now I think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Like it! I should say we did!” cried the
smallest of the three lads grouped about the one
in the centre. “Why, it’s the best ever!” and
he did a spread eagle on his skates, so full of life
did he feel that crisp December day.</p>

<p>“Do you really think we can get any game?”
asked Jack Fitch, as he loosed his mackinaw at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the throat, for he had warmed himself by a vigorous
burst of skating just before the little halt
that had ended in the impromptu vote of thanks
to Tom.</p>

<p>“Get game? Well, I should say we could!”
cried another of the lads.</p>

<p>“What do you know about it, Bert Wilson?”
demanded Jack. “Were you ever up there?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’m sure Tom Fairfield wouldn’t ask
us up to a hunter’s camp unless he was reasonably
sure that we could get some kind of game. I’m
not very particular what kind,” Bert went on, “as
long as it’s game&mdash;a bear, a mountain lion, a
lynx&mdash;I’m not hard to suit,” he added magnanimously.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say not!” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“But say!” exclaimed the youngest member of
the quartette&mdash;George Abbot by name. “Do you
really think we can bag a bear? Or a lynx, maybe?
Or even a fox? Are there really any big
animals up there, Tom? What sort of a gun had
I better take? And what about an outfit? Do
you think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tom reached out and gently placed a gloved
hand over the mouth of the questioner, thereby
cutting off, for the time being, the flow of interrogations.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Why, if you please,” he said,
giving George the nickname his fellow students at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Elmwood Hall had fastened on the lad who
seemed to be a human question mark.</p>

<p>“Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;Buu&mdash;er&mdash;gurg&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But that was the nearest semblance to speaking
that George could accomplish. His companions
laughed at him. He finally made a sign that he
would desist if Tom removed the hand-gag, and
when this had been done, Jack proposed a little
sprint down to one end of the small lake on which
they were skating.</p>

<p>“No, we’ve had enough racing to-day,” declared
Bert Wilson. “I vote Tom tells us more
about this hunters’ camp, and what we expect to
do there.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m agreeable,” Jack said.</p>

<p>“Are they&mdash;&mdash;?” began Why, but a look from
Bert warned him, and he stopped midway in his
question. His chums well knew that if George
once got started it was hard to stop him.</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t so much to tell that you fellows
don’t know already,” began Tom slowly.
“In the first place, there are three hunters’ camps,
not one.”</p>

<p>“Three!” exclaimed Jack and Bert, while
George looked the questions he dared not ask.</p>

<p>“Yes. You see they belong to a party of gentlemen,
a sort of camping club. The camps are
about five miles apart, in the wildest part of the
Adirondacks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why&mdash;three?” came at last from George.
Really he could not keep it back any longer.
Tom did not seem to mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose they wanted to change their
hunting ground,” he answered, “and they found
it easier to make three camps, or headquarters,
than to come all the way back to the first one.
And the club is pretty well off, so it didn’t mind
the expense.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t mean to say we can use all
three of ’em?” cried Jack, incredulously.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” Tom said. “We’re just as
welcome to use all three camps as one. They’re
all about alike, each with a log cabin, nicely fitted
up, set in the midst of the big woods.”</p>

<p>“That’s jolly!” cried Bert.</p>

<p>“And aren’t the men themselves going to use
them?” George wanted to know. Again he went
unrebuked.</p>

<p>“Not this season,” Tom Fairfield explained.
“The club is sort of broken up for the time being.
Some of the men want to go, but they can’t get
enough together to make a party, so they had to
give up their annual holiday outing this year.</p>

<p>“A business friend of my father’s belongs to
the club, and he mentioned to Dad that there was
a chance for someone to use the camps. Dad happened
to speak of it to me, and I&mdash;well, you can
imagine what I did! I jumped at the chance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
now you know almost as much as I do about it.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later just where the camps are,
and how we are to get to them. We want to get
together and have a talk about what we’ll take
with us. School closes here day after to-morrow,
and then we’ll be free for nearly a month.”</p>

<p>“And won’t we have some ripping old times,
though!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say yes!” chimed in Bert.</p>

<p>“Tell you what let’s do, fellows!” broke in
George. “Let’s go up to the top of that hill and
have a coast. Some of our lads from Elmwood
are there with the bobs, and they’ll give us a ride.
I’ve had enough of skating.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” chimed in Jack.</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” agreed Bert, stooping to
loosen his skates, an example followed by Tom
Fairfield.</p>

<p>“I hope this snowy weather holds,” spoke Jack.
“But are you allowed to shoot game when there
is tracking snow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t just know all the rules,” said Tom,
“but of course we will do what is right. I guess
we’ll have plenty of snow in the mountains, and
cold weather, too.”</p>

<p>“It’s getting warm here,” observed Bert.
“Too warm,” for the variable New Jersey climate
had changed from freezing almost to thawing
in the night, and the boys were really taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
advantage of the last bit of skating they were
likely to have in some time.</p>

<p>There were not many besides themselves on
the ice of the lake when they started from it,
heading for the big hill not far away&mdash;a hill
whereon the youth of Elmwood Hall, a boarding
school near the Jersey state capital, had many
jolly times.</p>

<p>When Tom Fairfield and his chums, talking
about the camping and hunting trip in prospect,
reached the hill, they found it deserted&mdash;that is,
by all save a few small town boys with their little
sleds.</p>

<p>“No coasting to-day,” observed Jack, ruefully.</p>

<p>“No, it’s getting too soft,” added Bert, digging
his foot into the snowy surface of the hill.
But the small boys did not mind that. With the
big lads out of the way, smaller fry had a chance.</p>

<p>George Abbot picked up a handful of snow and
rolled it into a ball. As he noticed how well it
packed, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, another idea!”</p>

<p>“Ha! He’s full of ’em to-day!” laughed Jack.</p>

<p>“Get rid of it, Why,” advised Tom. “Don’t
keep ideas in your system.”</p>

<p>“Let’s roll a whopping big snowball,” proposed
George, “and send it down hill. It will roll all
the way to the bottom, and pick up snow all the
way down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“It will be some snowball when it gets to the
bottom,” observed Tom. “This snow does pack
wonderfully well,” he added, testing it.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried George, and he started to
roll the ball. In a few minutes he had one so large
that it needed two to shove it about, and as it
gathered layer after layer of snow, it accumulated
in size until the strength of the four lads was
barely sufficient to send it slowly along.</p>

<p>“Now to the top of the hill with it!” cried
Tom, and it was placed on the brink. The boys
held it at a point where it would not interfere
with the small coasters. It was poised on the
brink a moment.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“There she goes!” echoed Jack Fitch.</p>

<p>They shoved the ball down the slope. On and
on it rolled, gaining in momentum and size with
every bound.</p>

<p>“Look at it!” cried George. “Say, it sure is
going!”</p>

<p>“And it’s getting as big as a house!” excitedly
shouted Bert.</p>

<p>“It will roll all the way across the lake,” said
Tom, for the frozen body of water was at the
foot of the hill, and it did seem as though the
snowball had momentum enough to carry it over
the ice.</p>

<p>A moment later the ball was at the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
hill, and rolling along with increasing speed. And
then, so suddenly that the boys were startled with
fear, something happened.</p>

<p>Out on the ice drove a horse and a cutter, containing
a man. He had left the road and taken a
short cut across the ice. And now he was directly
in the path of the immense, rolling snowball.</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop!” cried Tom Fairfield. “Look
out!”</p>

<p>But it was too late to stop, even if the man
in the cutter had heard him.</p>

<p>On rushed the great ball directly toward the
horse and vehicle.</p>

<small>A SURPRISE</small></h2>


<p>“Say, it’s going to hit him, sure as fate!” cried
Tom.</p>

<p>“No help for it,” half-groaned Jack.</p>

<p>“And there will be some smash!” murmured
Bert. “Oh, what did you do it for, George?”</p>

<p>“Me do it? Why, say, you fellows had as
much to do with it as I did! I didn’t do it all!”
and the smaller lad looked indignantly at his companions.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Tom, as he started on a run
down the snowy side of the hill.</p>

<p>The others followed.</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything!” shouted Jack.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” agreed Bert. “By the time
we get there&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence. All this while
the big snowball had been rushing on. The man
in the cutter had seen it, but too late. He tried
to whip up the horse and get out of the way, but
even as Bert spoke the mass of snow struck fairly
between the horse and cutter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>In an instant the vehicle was overturned.</p>

<p>The boys, running to the rescue, had a confused
vision of a man flying out to one side, head first,
toward a snowbank. They also saw the horse
rear up on his hind legs, struggle desperately to
retain his balance and then, with a fierce leap,
break loose from the cutter and run on, free,
across the ice.</p>

<p>As the boys hastened on, they saw the man
slowly pick himself up out of the snowbank, and
gaze wonderingly about him, as if trying to
fathom what had happened, whether it had been
an earthquake or an avalanche. Indeed, so large
was the snowball, and so strong was the force of
it, for it had gained speed by the rush down the
steep hill, that it really was a small avalanche.</p>

<p>The ball had split into several pieces on hitting
the cutter, the shafts of which were broken and
splintered, showing how the horse had been able
to free himself.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to&mdash;to apologize,” murmured
Tom, as he and his companions kept on toward
the man who was now gazing down disconsolately
at the ruin wrought.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess we will,” agreed Jack. “We&mdash;why,
Cæsar’s corn-plasters!” he cried. “Look
who it is&mdash;Professor Skeel!”</p>

<p>“The old tyrant of Elmwood Hall!” murmured
Bert. “Who’d have thought it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now we are in for it,” added Tom, grimly.</p>

<p>“Burton Skeel!” said George in a whisper as
he caught sight of the angry-looking man, gazing
at his smashed cutter and staring off over the ice
in the direction taken by the runaway horse.
“Skeel, the man who made so much trouble for
Tom Fairfield. And we upset him! Oh&mdash;good-night!”</p>

<p>Those of you who have read the first volume of
this series, entitled “Tom Fairfield’s Schooldays,”
do not need to be introduced to Professor Skeel.
The unpopular instructor of Elmwood Hall,
where Tom and his chums attended, had been the
cause of a rebellion, in which Tom was a sort of
leader, and, later, a pacifier. Tom Fairfield, the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Brokaw Fairfield, of Briartown,
N. J., had made himself popular soon after
coming to Elmwood, where he had been sent to
board while his parents went to Australia about
some property matters.</p>

<p>And now to find that the man upset from his
cutter was this same unpopular teacher, Professor
Skeel, was enough to give pause to any set of lads.</p>

<p>But Tom Fairfield was no coward. He proved
that when the <i>Silver Star</i> was wrecked, an account
of which you may read of in my second volume,
called “Tom Fairfield at Sea,” for the days that
followed the foundering of that vessel were trying
ones indeed, and the dreary days spent in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
open boat, when Mr. Skeel proved himself not
only a coward, but almost a scoundrel, showed
Tom fully what sort of a man the professor was.</p>

<p>Tom finally reached Australia, and set out on
another voyage in time to rescue his parents from
some savages on one of the Pacific islands. So
it was such qualities as these, and those developed
when Tom had other adventures, set forth in the
third book, “Tom Fairfield in Camp,” that made
our hero keep on instead of turning back when
he found what had happened to Mr. Skeel.</p>

<p>In camp Tom and his chums succeeded in clearing
up the mystery of the old mill, though for a
time it seemed that they were doomed to failure.
But Tom was not one to give up easily, and this,
I think, was more fully shown, perhaps, in the
volume immediately preceding this, called “Tom
Fairfield’s Pluck and Luck.”</p>

<p>True, Tom did have “luck,” but, after all, what
is luck but hard work turned to the best advantage?
Almost any chap can have luck if he works
hard, and takes advantage of every opportunity.</p>

<p>And now, after many weeks of tribulations,
Tom found himself at the beginning of the Christmas
holidays, and he and his chums had in prospect
a very enjoyable time.</p>

<p>But just at the present moment they would have
given up part of anticipated pleasures, I believe,
not to have had the snowball accident happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> Skeel,” murmured Tom, as though at
first he had doubted the evidence of his own eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“And we’re in for trouble, or I miss my guess,”
added Bert.</p>

<p>“I wonder what in the world he is doing in
these parts?” came from George. “You thought
you’d seen the last of him, didn’t you, Tom, after
the wreck of the <i>Silver Star</i>?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did.”</p>

<p>“And yet he bobs up again,” went on George.
“What does he want? Is he trying to get back
on the faculty of Elmwood Hall?”</p>

<p>No one answered his questions, nor did Tom, or
any of the others, rebuke Why for his queries.
They had too much else to think about.</p>

<p>“Well, young men, well!” began Professor
Skeel in his pompous voice. “Well, are you responsible
for this?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’m afraid we are,” said Tom. He did
not add “sir,” as once he would have done. He
had lost the little respect he had for the former
teacher, and when a man loses the respect of a
manly youth, it is not good for that man.</p>

<p>“Humph! Yes, you certainly have done mischief
enough,” went on Mr. Skeel, in snarling
tones. “My cutter is broken, I am thrown out,
and may have sustained there are no telling what
injuries, my horse has run away and may be killed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and you stand there like&mdash;like blithering idiots!”
he cried, with something of his old, objectionable,
schoolroom manner.</p>

<p>“We&mdash;we didn’t mean to,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“We just made a big snowball and rolled it
down,” George said, determined to take his share
of the blame.</p>

<p>“Hum! Yes, so I see&mdash;and so I <em>felt</em>, young
men!” cried the irate man, as he brushed the
snow off his garments.</p>

<p>The boys had not yet gotten over the surprise
of identifying Professor Skeel. They could not
understand it.</p>

<p>“We will do anything we can to make amends,”
Tom said, slinging his skates over his shoulder
with a jangling of steel. “We will try to catch
your horse, and we can get you another cutter.
We are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Something in Tom’s voice caused the man to
look up quickly. As he did so Tom noticed that
his right ear appeared as though it had been recently
injured. The lower part was torn and hung
down below the other lobe.</p>

<p>“Ha! So it’s you, is it!” fairly snarled Mr.
Skeel. “It’s you, Tom Fairfield?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Skeel. And I can only say how
sorry I am&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me how sorry you are!” interrupted
the former teacher, in a voice filled with passion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“I don’t want to listen to you. I’ve had
enough of you. Don’t you dare to address me!</p>

<p>“This was done on purpose. It was a deliberate
attempt to injure me, perhaps kill me, for all
I know. But I will not submit. I will at once go
to town and cause your arrest, Tom Fairfield.
The arrest of yourself, and those rascals with you.
I’ll have you all arrested.”</p>

<p>George turned pale under his ruddy cheeks. He
was not afraid, but he was thinking of the disgrace.
But Tom Fairfield was master of the situation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t have anyone arrested if I were
you, Mr. Skeel,” he said, in easy tones.</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall, too!” blustered the man. “I’ll
have you all arrested! The idea of rolling a
snowball on me and almost killing me. I’ll have
everyone of you arrested.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t,” Tom said. “You forget
that little matter of the forgery, Mr. Skeel. That
indictment is still hanging over you, I believe.
And if you were to go to the authorities, it might
come out, and there would be some other arrests
than ours. So if I were you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not need to finish. Mr. Skeel turned
pale and uttered an exclamation under his breath.</p>

<p>At that moment George created a diversion by
crying:</p>

<p>“Here comes your horse back.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THE PLOT</small></h2>


<p>George Abbot was not exactly correct in saying
that the runaway horse was <em>coming</em> back. The
animal was being brought back, and he seemed
quiet and docile enough. Perhaps he had lost his
fright in the run he had taken after being freed
from the cutter.</p>

<p>“Who’s leading the horse?” asked Bert Wilson,
while Tom turned to look, after having faced
the angry professor until the latter turned aside
his head. Well he knew that Tom spoke the
truth. A shady transaction, while a member of
the Elmwood faculty, had placed Professor Skeel
under the ban of the law, and he realized that he
could not appeal to it without bringing himself
into its clutches.</p>

<p>“That’s Morse Denton with the animal,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“Morse must have caught him before he went
very far, or he wouldn’t be back so soon,” spoke
Bert, waving his hand toward the former Freshman
football captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does that horse belong there?” Morse called
across the ice.</p>

<p>“Yes, bring him over here,” said Tom. “Perhaps
we can patch up the shafts and send you on
your way again, Professor Skeel,” Tom went on,
for he did not hold enmity, and he was willing to
let bygones be bygones, if the professor did not
push matters too far.</p>

<p>“Um!” was all the answer the former teacher
vouchsafed. He was arranging his garments,
which had been rather twisted, to say the least,
by his sudden exit from the cutter.</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Morse, when he led
the horse up to the little group standing partly on
the ice of the lake and partly on the shore, for the
accident had happened close to the edge.</p>

<p>“It was a big snowball,” volunteered George.
“We rolled it down the hill, and Professor Skeel
ran into it.”</p>

<p>“Be correct, young man. Be correct!” growled
the former instructor. “The snowball ran into
me, but I’ll have satisfaction. I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He caught Tom’s eye on him, and fairly quailed.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Professor Skeel!” cried Morse.
“Where did you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Tom gave Morse a quick and secret sign to
cease questioning, and the newcomer, still holding
the captured horse, acquiesced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is the animal hurt?” demanded the former
teacher.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t seem to be,” Morse replied. “I saw
him coming at a slow canter across the ice, and I
had no trouble in stopping him. I guessed it was
a runaway and I started him back in just the
opposite direction to that he was going. Then I
saw you fellows,” he added to his chums.</p>

<p>“I have told Professor Skeel how sorry I am
that the accident occurred,” went on Tom, “and
I have assured him that we will do all that we
can to repair the damage.” He was speaking
slowly and with reserve, and choosing his words
carefully.</p>

<p>“Repair the damage!” snapped the man.</p>

<p>“The shafts are all that seem to be broken,”
proceeded Tom. “I know a farmer near here,
and I’m sure he will lend you another pair of
shafts for your cutter. The harness is not damaged,
the cutter itself is all right, and the horse
is not hurt. There is no reason why you should
not continue your journey, Professor Skeel.”</p>

<p>“Well, do something then, don’t stand there
talking about it!” burst out the irritated man.</p>

<p>Tom did not answer, and his chums rather marveled,
for Tom was not the youth to take abuse
quietly. But Tom realized that, through no fault
of his own, Professor Skeel had been put to serious
inconvenience, and it was no more than just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that the lads should make good the damage they
had unwittingly done.</p>

<p>“Let’s set up the cutter, fellows,” proposed
Tom, after a pause, “and then we’ll see about
getting another pair of shafts. We can’t use
these, that’s certain.” They were splintered beyond
repair.</p>

<p>The boys of Elmwood Hall were used to doing
things quickly, especially under Tom’s leadership.
In a trice the cutter was righted, and the robes
and the scattered possessions of Professor Skeel
were picked up and put into it. Then while
Morse, George and Bert remained to adjust the
harness on the now quieted horse, Tom and Jack
went to a farmhouse near the lake to borrow a
spare pair of shafts.</p>

<p>Tom knew the farmer, of whom he had often
hired a team in the summer, and the man readily
agreed not only to loan the shafts, but to adjust
them to the cutter.</p>

<p>He made a quick and neat job of it, and soon
the horse was once more hitched to the righted
vehicle.</p>

<p>“There you are, Professor Skeel,” said Tom.
“Not quite as good as before, but almost. You
can keep on, and once more I wish to tell you
how sorry I am that it happened.”</p>

<p>“Um!” sneered Mr. Skeel.</p>

<p>“You may not believe it,” Tom went on. “We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
did not see you coming until we had started the
ball down hill, and then it was too late to stop
it. We never thought anyone would cross the
lake on the ice at this point, as no one ever does
so.”</p>

<p>“I had a right to, didn’t I?” demanded the
irate professor.</p>

<p>“A right, certainly,” agreed Tom. “But it is
unusual. Teams go down on the lake about a
mile farther on, and you would have been perfectly
safe there.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I guess I can cross this lake where
I please! And the next time you roll a snowball
on me, I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I told you,” said Tom, and his voice was cuttingly
cool, “that we did not roll the ball on you.
It was unintentional, but if you persist in thinking
we did it purposely, we can’t help that. Now, is
there anything more we can do for you?” and
he looked about the snow to make sure all the
contents of the cutter had been picked up and returned
to it.</p>

<p>The professor did not answer, but busied himself
getting into the vehicle, and taking the reins
from Morse Denton.</p>

<p>“You can send them spare shafts back any
time,” said the farmer who had kindly loaned
them.</p>

<p>“We’ll pay for ’em if he doesn’t,” said Jack in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a low voice, anxious to preserve peace. “It’s
getting off cheap as it is,” he added.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bert. “I thought he’d
raise no end of a row.”</p>

<p>“So he would have&mdash;only for Tom. Tom
closed him up in great shape, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He sure did.”</p>

<p>Without a word of thanks, Professor Skeel
drove off over the ice. He never looked back,
but the boys could hear him muttering angrily to
himself, probably giving vent to threats he dared
not utter aloud.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he is doing in this neighborhood?”
ventured Bert.</p>

<p>“It’s certainly a puzzle,” admitted Tom Fairfield.
“He’s up to no good, I’ll wager.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jack. “Well, I’m glad
he’s gone, anyhow. That sure was some upset!”</p>

<p>“Say, did you notice his ear?” asked George.
“It wasn’t that way when he was teaching school
here. Looks as if a knife had cut him.”</p>

<p>“Was his ear like that when he was shipwrecked
with you, Tom?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“No. That’s a new injury,” was the answer.
“Rather a queer one, too. He might have been
in a fight.”</p>

<p>The lads remained standing together, for a little
while, gazing at the now fast-disappearing
cutter and its surly occupant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, let’s get back to school,” proposed Jack.
“It will soon be grub-time.”</p>

<p>“And Tom can tell us more about that hunting
trip,” suggested Bert.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed our hero, but as he walked
along he was puzzling his brain, trying to think
what Professor Skeel’s object was in coming back
to Elmwood Hall.</p>

<p>Perhaps if Tom could have seen Mr. Skeel a
little later, as the cutter drew up at a road-house
some miles away&mdash;a road-house that did not have
a very enviable reputation in the neighborhood&mdash;Tom
would have wondered still more over his
former teacher’s return.</p>

<p>For, as the cutter drew up in the drive, there
peered from a window two men, one with a more
evil-looking face than the other, which was his
only claim to distinction.</p>

<p>“There he comes,” murmured the man with
the less-evil countenance.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s late,” agreed the other. “Wonder
what kept him?”</p>

<p>“He looks mad&mdash;too,” commented his companion.</p>

<p>A few moments later Professor Skeel entered
the rear room of the road-house. The two men
arose from the table at which they had been sitting.</p>

<p>“Well, you kept your word, I see,” muttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Skeel to the man with the evil face. “You’re
here, Whalen. And you too, Murker.”</p>

<p>“Yes. We’re here, but you didn’t say what
you wanted of us,” spoke the one addressed as
Whalen.</p>

<p>“You’ll know soon enough,” was the rejoinder.
“We sha’n’t want anything&mdash;at least not for a
while,” Mr. Skeel went on to the landlord, who
had followed him into the room. “You can leave
us alone. We’ll ring when we want you. And
close the door when you go out,” he added, significantly.</p>

<p>The landlord grunted.</p>

<p>“Well, now, what’s the game?” asked Whalen,
when Mr. Skeel had seated himself at the table.</p>

<p>“Revenge! That’s the game!” was the fierce
answer, and a fist was banged down on the table.
“I want revenge, and I’m going to have it!”</p>

<p>“Who’s the party?” demanded Murker.</p>

<p>“Someone you don’t know, but whom you may
soon. Tom Fairfield! I owe him a long score,
but I’m going to begin to pay it now. I want you
to help me, Whalen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll help you quick enough,” was the ready
answer.</p>

<p>“He was instrumental in having you discharged
from Elmwood Hall, wasn’t he?” went on the
former instructor.</p>

<p>“That’s what he was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Something about beating one of the smaller
boys, was it not?” and Skeel smiled in a suggestive
way, as though he rather relished, than otherwise,
the plight of Whalen.</p>

<p>“Naw, I only gave the kid a few taps ’cause
he threw a snowball at me,” the discharged employee
went on, “but that whelp, Fairfield, saw
me, and complained to Doc. Meredith. Then I
was fired.”</p>

<p>“And you’d like a chance to get even, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I would!” was the harsh answer.</p>

<p>“Well, I want to square accounts with him
also, and, at the same time, make a little money
out of it. I thought you and Murker could help
me, and that’s why I asked you to meet me here.
I’m a bit late, and that’s some more of Fairfield’s
doings. Now to business. This is the game!”</p>

<p>And the three plotters drew their chairs closer
together and began to talk in low, mumbling
voices.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>HOLIDAY FUN</small></h2>


<p>“Jolly times to-night, fellows!” exclaimed
Jack Fitch as he, with Tom and the other chums,
walked along the snowy road on their way back
to Elmwood Hall. “No boning to do, and we
can slip away with some eats on the side and have
a grub-fest.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in Bert Wilson.
“Maybe you’d better put off telling us about the
hunting trip, Tom, until we all get together. Suppose
we meet in my room&mdash;it’s bigger.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tom. “Anything suits me
as long as you fellows don’t grab all the crackers
and cheese before I get there.”</p>

<p>“We’ll save you a share,” promised Morse
Denton.</p>

<p>“I’ve got part of a box of oranges my folks
sent me,” volunteered George Abbot.</p>

<p>“Bring ’em along,” advised Jack. “They’ll
come in handy to throw at the fellows if any of
’em try to break in on us.”</p>

<p>“What! Throw my oranges!” cried George.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
“Say, they’re the finest Indian Rivers, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All right. If they’re rivers, we’ll let ’em swim
instead of throwing ’em,” conceded Bert. “Anything
to be agreeable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say now!” protested George, who did
not always know how, or when, to take a joke.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, don’t let ’em fuss you,” advised
Tom in a low voice. “But, fellows, we’d better
hustle if we’re going to have doings to-night.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chorused the others, and they
set off at a rapid pace toward Elmwood Hall,
which could be seen in the distance, the red setting
sun of the December day lighting up its tower
and belfry. The skates of the students jangled
and clanked as they hurried on, making a musical
sound in the frosty air, for it was getting colder
with the approach of night.</p>

<p>“Seasonable weather,” murmured Jack. “It’ll
be a lot colder than this up in the Adirondacks,
when we start hunting deer and bear.”</p>

<p>“What’s all this?” asked Morse, with a sudden
show of interest.</p>

<p>“Some of Tom’s schemes,” answered Jack.
“We’re going on a hunting trip.”</p>

<p>Morse looked to Tom for confirmation.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” Tom said, briefly sketching
his plan. “Bert, Jack and George are going with
me. Like to have you come along.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to, first rate, old man,” was the answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
given with a shake of the head, “but the
governor has planned a trip to Palm Beach for
the whole family, over Christmas, and I have to
go along to keep order.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” voiced Tom, but his words were
lost in a gale of laughter from his chums as they
sensed the final words of Morse.</p>

<p>“You keep order! You’re a fine one for that!”</p>

<p>“The fellow who tied the cow to Merry’s back
stoop!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the lad who put the smoke bomb in
the furnace room! A fine chap to keep things
straight!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you don’t have to believe me!”
said Morse, with an air of injured innocence that
ill became him.</p>

<p>“They evidently don’t,” commented Tom dryly.</p>

<p>“Say, what was the row about just before I
came back with that horse?” asked Morse, as
though he wanted to change the subject.</p>

<p>“Snowball and old Skeel,” explained Tom
briefly. “It was sort of a case of a perfectly
irresistible force coming in contact with a perfectly
immovable body&mdash;but not quite,” and he
went more into the details of the accident on the
ice.</p>

<p>“Humph! He must have been pretty mad,”
commented Morse.</p>

<p>“He was. Threatened arrest and all that. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Tom calmed him down,” said Jack with a chuckle.
“I guess Skeel didn’t want to see the police very
badly.”</p>

<p>“What gets me, though,” spoke George, in
his perpetually questioning voice, “was what Skeel
was doing around here.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know that myself,” voiced Tom.
But he was not to know until later, and then to
his sorrow.</p>

<p>As the group of lads progressed, they were
joined, from time to time, by other students from
Elmwood, who had been out enjoying the day
either by skating, coasting or sledding, and it
was a merry party that approached the gate, or
main entrance to the grounds, passing through
the quadrangle of main buildings, and scattering
to their various dormitories.</p>

<p>The holiday spirit was abroad. It was in the
air&mdash;everywhere&mdash;the glorious spirit of Christmas,
the day of which was not far distant. The
boys seemed to know that the school discipline
would be somewhat relaxed, though they did not
take too much advantage of it.</p>

<p>Various engagements were made for surreptitious
parties to meet here and there, to enjoy forbidden,
and, therefore, all the more delightful,
midnight lunches. The lads had been saving part
of their allowances for some time, just for this
occasion, and some had even arranged to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
away with them, from the refectory, some of
their supper that night.</p>

<p>In due time a merry little party had gathered
in the room of Bert Wilson in one of the larger
and newer dormitories. The boys slid in, one by
one, taking reasonable care not to meet with any
prowling professor or monitor. But they knew
that unless the rules were flagrantly violated, little
punishment would be meted out. Each lad who
came brought with him a more or less bulky package,
until Bert’s room looked like the headquarters
of some war, earthquake or flood-relief society,
as Tom said.</p>

<p>“And are these the oranges George boasted
of?” asked Jack, taking up one and sampling it.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they dandies?” demanded George.</p>

<p>“Whew! Oh, my! Who put orange skins on
these lemons?” demanded Jack, making a wry
face.</p>

<p>“Lemons?” faltered George, a look of alarm
spreading over his expressive countenance.</p>

<p>“Lemons?” cried Tom. “Let me taste.
Whew! I should say so,” he added. “They’re
as sour as citric acid.”</p>

<p>“And he said they came from Indian River,”
mocked Morse.</p>

<p>“Let’s throw ’em out the window,” proposed
Joe Rooney.</p>

<p>“And him after them!” added Lew Bentfield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, let’s save them to fire at Merry in chapel
in the morning,” was another suggestion.</p>

<p>“I say, you fellows,” began the badgered one,
“those oranges&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They’re all right&mdash;the boys are only stringing
you,” whispered Tom. “Don’t get on your ear.”</p>

<p>The advice came in good time. The arrival of
other revelers turned the topic of conversation.</p>

<p>“Oh, here’s Hen Watson. What you got,
Hen?”</p>

<p>“A cocoanut cake!” cried someone who looked
in the box Hen carried. “Where’d you get
that?”</p>

<p>“Bought it&mdash;where’d you s’pose?” asked Hen.
“Here, keep your fingers out of that!” he cried,
as Jack took a sample “punch” out of the top of
the pastry.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see if it was real,” was the justifying
answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s real all right.”</p>

<p>“Here’s Sam Black. What you got, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s all swelled up as though he had
the mumps.”</p>

<p>Sam did indeed bulge on every side. He did
not speak, but, entering the room, began to unload
himself of bottled soda and root beer. From
every pocket he took a bottle&mdash;two from some&mdash;and
others from various nooks and corners of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
clothes, until the bed was half covered with bottled
delight.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s goin’ some!” murmured Jack enviously.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” agreed Tom. “We won’t die of
thirst from my olives now,” for Tom had brought
a generous supply of those among other things.</p>

<p>Someone leaned against the bed, and the bottles
rolled together with many a clatter and clash.</p>

<p>“Easy there!” cautioned Bert. “Do you want
to bring the whole building up here? Remember
this isn’t the dining-hall. Go easy!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to,” spoke George, the offending
one.</p>

<p>Gradually the room filled, until it was a task to
move about in it, but this was no detriment at all
to the lads. Then in the dim light of a few
shaded candles, for they did not want the glimmer
of the electrics to disclose the affair to some
watching monitor, the feast began.</p>

<p>It was eminently successful, and the viands disappeared
as if by magic. The empty bottles were
set aside so their accidental fall would not make
too much noise.</p>

<p>Gradually jaws began to move more slowly up
and down in the process of mastication, and
tongues began to wag more freely, though in
guarded tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“This sure is one great, little Christmas
feed!” commented Jack.</p>

<p>“All to the horse-radish,” agreed Tom. “But
it’s nothing to what we’ll have when we get up in
the Adirondack camp, fellows. I wish you were
all coming.”</p>

<p>“So do we!” chorused those who were not
going, for various reasons.</p>

<p>“Hark! What’s that?” suddenly cried
George. Instantly there was silence.</p>

<p>“Nothing but the wind,” said Tom. “Say,
fellows,” he went on, “I have an idea.”</p>

<p>“Chain it!” advised Jack. “They’re rare
birds these days.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hear what it is,” suggested Bert. “If
it’s any good, we’ll do it.”</p>

<small>OFF TO CAMP</small></h2>


<p>Tom Fairfield disposed himself comfortably
on the bed before replying. There was room
there, now, for the food and drink had been disposed
of. Tom stretched out, finished a half-consumed
sardine sandwich, and went on.</p>

<p>“You know old Efficiency, don’t you?” began
Tom, with tantalizing slowness.</p>

<p>“I should say we did!” came in a whispered
chorus.</p>

<p>“The prof who’s always lecturing on improving
your opportunities, isn’t he?” asked a student
who had not been at Elmwood very long.</p>

<p>“That’s the one,” resumed Tom. “You know
he claims we all eat and drink too much. He
holds that a person should find the minimum
amount of food on which he can live, and take
no more than that.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had more than my share to-night, all
right,” comfortably murmured Jack.</p>

<p>“And Efficiency, as we call him,” went on Tom,
“is a hater of feasting of any sort, unless it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a feast of reason. I think he lives on half a
cracker and a gill of milk a day, or something like
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the idea?” asked Bert, impatiently.</p>

<p>“This,” answered Tom, calmly. “We will take
the remains of our herewith feast, the broken victuals,
the things in which they were contained, the
empty tins, the depleted bottles, and deposit them
on the doorstep of the domicile of Professor Hazeltine,
otherwise known as Old Efficiency. When
they are seen there it will show to the world that
he does not practice what he preaches.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment following
Tom’s announcement, and then came chuckles
and smothered laughter.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s a good one all right!”</p>

<p>“It sure is!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! Ha! It takes Tom Fairfield to
think ’em out!”</p>

<p>“Easy there!” Bert cautioned them. “You’ll
give the whole snap away, if you’re not careful.”</p>

<p>“Well, shall we do it?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I should say we will!” declared Jack.</p>

<p>“Then gather up the stuff and come along, a
few at a time,” advised the ringleader. “We
don’t want to make too much noise.”</p>

<p>A little later dark and silent figures might have
been observed stealing across the school campus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
carrying various objects. The front stoop of the
professor, who was such a stickler for efficiency
and the maximum of effect with the minimum of
effort, was in the shadow, and soon it was piled
high with many things.</p>

<p>Emptied sardine tins, olive bottles which contained
only the appetizing odor, pasteboard cartons
of crackers or other cakes, ginger-ale bottles
with only a few drops of the beverage in the bottom,
papers and paper bags, the pasteboard circlets
from Charlotte russes&mdash;these and many more
things from the forbidden midnight feast were
piled on the steps. Then the conspirators stole
away, one by one, as they had come.</p>

<p>Tom Fairfield lingered last to make a more
artistic arrangement of the empty bottles; then
he, too, joined his chums.</p>

<p>“I rather guess that’ll make ’em lie down and
close their eyes,” he said, in distinction to the
process of “sitting up and taking notice.”</p>

<p>“It sure will,” agreed Jack, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>There were whispered good-nights, pre-holiday
greetings and then the students sought their
rooms, for there was a limit beyond which they
did not want to stretch matters.</p>

<p>In the morning they were sufficiently rewarded
for their efforts&mdash;if rewarded be the proper word.</p>

<p>Professor Hazeltine, going to his front door
to get his early morning paper, saw the array of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bottles and debris. At first he could not believe
the evidence of his eyesight, but a second look
convinced him that he could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>“The shame of it!” he murmured. “The
shame of that disgraceful gorging of food. They
must be made an example of&mdash;no matter who they
are. The shame of it! I shall report them! Oh,
the waste here represented! The shameful waste
of food! I suppose all that is here represented
was consumed in a single night. It might have
lasted a month. I shall see that they are punished,
not only for their disgraceful action in thus
littering my stoop, but for gorging themselves
like beasts!”</p>

<p>But the professor forgot one thing, namely, that
to punish a culprit one must first know who he is,
and how to catch him. It was the old application
of first get your rabbit, though doubtless the professor
would have changed the proverb to some
milder form of food.</p>

<p>However, he took up his paper, ordered the
servant to remove the debris, and then proceeded
to his simple breakfast of a certain bran-like food
mingled with milk, a bit of dry toast and a cup
of corn-coffee. After which, bristling with as
much indignation as he could summon on such
cold and clammy food, he went to Dr. Meredith
and complained.</p>

<p>The Head smiled tolerantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must remember that it is the holiday
season,” he said. “Boys will be boys.”</p>

<p>“But, Doctor, I do not so much object to the
disgraceful exhibition they made of me. I can
stand that. No one who knows me, or my principles,
would think for a moment that I could consume
the amount of food represented there.”</p>

<p>“No, I think you would be held guiltless of
that,” agreed the President.</p>

<p>“But it is the fact that the young men&mdash;our
students&mdash;could so demean themselves like beasts
as to partake of so much gross food,” went on
Professor Hazeltine. “After all my talks, showing
the amount of work that can be done, mental
and physical, on a simple preparation of whole
wheat, to think of them having eaten sardines,
smoked beef, canned tongue, potted ham, canned
chicken&mdash;for I found tins representing all those
things on my steps, Dr. Meredith. It was awful!”</p>

<p>“Yes, the boys must have had a bountiful
feast,” agreed the President with a sigh.</p>

<p>Was it a sigh of regret that his days for enjoying
such forbidden midnight “feeds” were over?
For he was human.</p>

<p>“I want those boys punished, not so much for
what they did to me as for their own sakes,” demanded
Professor Hazeltine. “They must learn
that the brain works best on lighter foods, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
that to clog the body with gross meat is but to
stop the delicate machinery of the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know,” said Dr. Meredith, a bit
wearily. He had heard all that before. “Well,
I suppose the boys did do wrong, and if you will
bring me their names, I will speak to them.
Bring me their names, Professor Hazeltine.”</p>

<p>But that was easier said than done. Not that
“Efficiency” did not make the effort, but it was
a hopeless task. Of course none of the boys would
“peach,” and no one else knew who had been
involved.</p>

<p>Professor Hazeltine came in for some fun,
mildly poked at him by other members of the
faculty.</p>

<p>“I understand you had quite a banquet over at
your house last night,” remarked Professor Wirt.</p>

<p>“It was&mdash;disgraceful!” exploded the aggrieved
one, and he went on to point out how
the human body could live for weeks on a purely
cereal diet, with cold water only for drinking purposes.</p>

<p>So the boys had their fun; at least, it was fun
for them, and no great harm was done. Nor did
Professor Hazeltine discover who were the culprits.</p>

<p>The school was about to close for the long holiday
vacation. Already some of the students, living
at a distance, had departed. There were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
final days, when discipline was more than ever
relaxed. Few lectures were given, and fewer
attended.</p>

<p>Then came the last day, when farewells echoed
over the campus.</p>

<p>“Good-bye! Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p>“Happy New Year!”</p>

<p>“See you after the holidays!”</p>

<p>“Get together now, fellows, a last cheer for old
Elmwood Hall! We won’t see her again until
next year!”</p>

<p>Tom Fairfield led in the cheering, and then,
gathering his particular chums about him, gave a
farewell song. Then followed cheers for Dr.
Meredith, and someone called:</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Professor Hazeltine! May
his digestion never grow worse!”</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, ending with
a burst of laughter, for the professor in question
was observed to be shaking his fist at the students
out of his window. He had not forgiven the
midnight feast and its ending.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll soon be on our way,” said Tom
to Bert, Jack and George, as they sat together in
the railroad train, for they all lived in the same
part of New Jersey, and were on their way home.</p>

<p>“What’s the plan?” asked George.</p>

<p>“We’ll all meet at my house,” proposed Tom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“and go to New York City from there. Then
we can take the express for the Adirondacks. We
go to a small station called Hemlock Junction,
and travel the rest of the distance in a sleigh.
We’ll go to No. 1 Camp first, and see how we
like it. If we can’t get enough game there, we’ll
go on to the other camps. As I told you, we’ll
have the use of all three. None of the members
of the club will be up there this season.”</p>

<p>“But will whoever is in charge let us in?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, all arrangements have been made,” Tom
said. “There is grub up there, bedclothes, and
everything. All we’ll take is our clothes, guns and
cameras.”</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t forget the cameras,” urged Bert.
“I expect to get some fine snapshots up there.”</p>

<p>“And I hope we get some good gun-shots,”
put in Tom. “We’re going on a hunting trip,
please remember.”</p>

<p>The time of preparation passed quickly, and a
few days later, and shortly after Christmas, the
boys found themselves in the Grand Central Station,
New York, ready to take the train for camp.</p>

<p>They piled their belongings about them in the
parlor car, and then proceeded to talk of the delights
ahead of them, delights in which their fellow
passengers shared, for they listened with evident
pleasure to the conversation of our friends.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>DISQUIETING NEWS</small></h2>


<p>Three men sat in the back room of the road-house,
talking in whispers, a much-stained table
forming the nucleus of the group. Two of the
men were of evil faces, one not so much, perhaps,
as the other, while the third man’s countenance
showed some little refinement, though it was overlaid
with grossness, and the light in the eyes was
baleful.</p>

<p>The men were the same three who foregathered
as Tom Fairfield and his chums left the scene of
the snowball accident, and it was the same day as
that occurrence. It must not be supposed that the
men had been there during all the time I have
taken to describe the holiday scenes at Elmwood
Hall.</p>

<p>But I left the three men there, plotting, and now
it is time to return to them, since Tom and his
chums are well on their way to the winter camps
in the Adirondacks.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that plan?” asked
Professor Skeel, for he was one of the three men
in the back room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“It sounds all right,” half-growled, rather than
spoke, the man called Murker.</p>

<p>“If it can be done,” added the other&mdash;Whalen.</p>

<p>“Why can’t it be done?” demanded the former
instructor. “You did your part, didn’t you?
You found out where they were going, and all
that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I attended to that,” was the answer.
“But I don’t want to get into trouble over this
thing, and it sounds to me like trouble. It’s a
serious business to take&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind. You needn’t go into details,”
said Professor Skeel, quickly, stopping his henchman
with a warning look, as he glanced toward
the door through which the landlord had made his
egress.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to be arrested on a charge
of&mdash;&mdash;” the other insisted.</p>

<p>“There’ll be no danger at all!” broke in the
rascally teacher. “I’ll do the actual work myself.
I’ll take all the blame. All I want is your help.
I had to have someone get the information for
me, and you did that very well, Whalen. No one
else could have done it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I pumped him dry enough,” was
the chuckling comment.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity you had to go and get yourself discharged,
though,” went on Mr. Skeel. “You
would be much more useful to me at Elmwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Hall than out of it. But it can’t be helped, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t go and <em>get</em> myself discharged!”
whined he who was called Whalen. “It was that
whelp, Tom Fairfield, who was to blame.”</p>

<p>The man did not seem to count his own disgraceful
conduct at all.</p>

<p>“Well, if Tom Fairfield was to blame, so much
the better. We can kill two birds with one stone
in his case,” chuckled the professor. “Now I
think we understand each other. We needn’t
meet again until we are up&mdash;well, we’ll say up
North. That’s indefinite enough in case anyone
hears us talking, and I don’t altogether like the
looks of this landlord here.”</p>

<p>“No, he’s too nosey,” agreed Murker. “Well,
if that’s settled, I guess we’re ready for the next
move,” and he looked significantly at Mr. Skeel.</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that?” came the query.</p>

<p>“We could use a little money,” suggested the
evil-faced man.</p>

<p>“Money. Oh, yes. I did promise to bring you
some. Well, here it is,” and the former instructor
divided some bills between his followers and
fellow plotters.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll leave here alone,” he went on. “I
don’t want to be seen in your company outside.”</p>

<p>“Not good enough for you, I reckon,” sneered
Whalen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it might lead to&mdash;er&mdash;complications,”
was the retort. “So give me half an hour’s start.
I’m going to drive back where I hired this cutter,
and then take a train. You follow me in two days
and I rather guess Tom Fairfield will wish he’d
kept his fingers out of my pie!” cried Mr. Skeel,
with a burst of anger.</p>

<p>The three whispered together a few minutes
longer, and then the former instructor came out
of the road-house alone and drove off.</p>

<p>“What do you think of him?” asked Murker
of Whalen.</p>

<p>“Not an awful lot,” was the answer. “But
he’ll pay us well, and it will give me a chance to
get square with that Fairfield pup. I owe him
something.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care anything about him, one
way or the other,” was the rejoinder. “I went
into this thing because you asked me to, and to
make a bit of money. If I do that, I’m satisfied.
Now let’s get cigars and slide out of here at
once.”</p>

<p>And thus the plotters separated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tom and his friends were a merry
party. They talked, laughed and joked, now and
then casting glances at their pile of baggage,
which included gun cases and cameras. For they
were to do both kinds of hunting in the mountain
camps, and they were particularly interested in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
camera work, since they were taking up something
of nature study in their school course.</p>

<p>The railroad trip was without incident of moment,
if we except one little matter. It was when
George Abbot mentioned casually the name of
Whalen, one of the men employed at Elmwood
Hall.</p>

<p>“I wonder why he left so suddenly?” George
said, as they were speaking of some happening at
school.</p>

<p>“I guess I was to blame for that,” Tom explained,
as he related the incident of the cruel
treatment on the part of Whalen.</p>

<p>“I thought he looked rather sour,” went on
George.</p>

<p>“Why, were you talking to him lately?” asked
Tom, a sudden look of interest on his face.</p>

<p>“Yes, the day before we left the Hall. He
met me in town and borrowed a quarter from me.
Said he wanted to send a telegram to friends who
would give him work. Then he and I got talking,
and I happened to mention that we fellows were
going camping.”</p>

<p>“You did!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“This Whalen was quite interested,” resumed
George. “He asked me a lot of questions about
the location of the camps, and what route we were
going to take.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, yes, I told him some things. Any
harm?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know that there was,” spoke Tom
more slowly and thoughtfully. “But did Whalen
say why he wanted to know all that?”</p>

<p>“No, not definitely. He did mention, though,
that he might look for a job somewhere up North,
and I suppose that was why he asked so many
questions.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Tom, in a low voice. Then he
did some hard thinking.</p>

<p>In due time Hemlock Junction was reached.
This was the end of the train journey, and the
boys piled out with their baggage, their guns and
cameras. It was cold and snowing.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s our man over there,” remarked
Tom, indicating a person in a big overcoat with
a fur cap and a red scarf around his neck.
“Does he look as though his name was Sam
Wilson?” asked our hero of his chums.</p>

<p>“Why Sam Wilson?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Because that’s the name of the man who was
to meet us and drive us over to camp,” Tom said.</p>

<p>The man, with a smile illuminating his red
face, approached.</p>

<p>“Looks to be plenty of room in the pung,” remarked
Tom.</p>

<p>“What’s a pung?” asked George.</p>

<p>“That big sled, sort of two bobs made into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
one, with only a single set of runners,” explained
Tom, indicating the sled to which were hitched
four horses, whose every movement jingled a
chime of musical bells.</p>

<p>“Be you the Fairfield crowd?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“That’s us,” Tom said. “Are you Sam Wilson?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then, we are discovered, as the Indians said
to Columbus,” Jack murmured, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Pile in,” invited Sam Wilson, indicating the
pung. “I’ll get your traps. Ain’t this fine
weather, though?”</p>

<p>“It’s a bit cold,” Bert remarked.</p>

<p>“That’s what a party said that I drove over
to your camp the other day,” spoke Sam. “He
was from down Jersey way, too. You fellers
must be sort of cold-blooded down thar! This
chap complained of the cold. But pshaw! This
is mild to what we have sometimes. Yes, this
feller I drove over kept rubbin’ his ears all the
while. One ear was terrible red, and it wasn’t
all from the cold either. It had some sort of a
scar on it, like it had been chawed by some wild
critter. It sure was a funny ear!”</p>

<p>Tom looked at his chums with startled gaze.
This was disquieting news indeed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>AT CAMP</small></h2>


<p>Seemingly by common consent on the part of
Tom’s chums, it was left for him to further question
Sam Wilson and learn more about the man
the caretaker had driven over to the hunting
camp. And Tom was not slow to follow up the
matter. He had his own suspicions, but he
wanted to verify them.</p>

<p>“You say you drove someone over to our camp
yesterday?” Tom asked.</p>

<p>“Not yesterday, the day before,” was the answer.
“And it wasn’t exactly to your camp, but
near it. Your camp is a private one, you know&mdash;that
is, it belongs to an association, and I understand
you boys are to have full run of all three
places.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the gentlemen who make up the organization
very kindly gave us that privilege,” assented
Tom.</p>

<p>“Then you’re the only ones allowed to use the
camps,” went on Sam. “I’ll see to that, being
the official keeper. I’m in charge the year around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and sometimes I am pretty hard put to keep people
out that have no business in. So, naturally,
I wouldn’t drive no stranger over to one of <em>my</em>
camps&mdash;I call ’em mine,” he added with a smile,
“but of course I’m only the keeper.”</p>

<p>“We understand,” spoke Tom, and his tone
was grave.</p>

<p>“Well, then you understand I wouldn’t let anyone
in at the camps unless they came introduced,
same as you boys did.”</p>

<p>“Well, where did you drive this man then&mdash;this
man with&mdash;&mdash;” began George, but Jack silenced
him with a look, nodding as much as to
say that it was Tom’s privilege to do the questioning.</p>

<p>“I drove this man over to Hounson’s place,”
resumed the camp-keeper, as he saw that all the
baggage was piled in the pung. “This man
Hounson keeps what he calls a hunters’ camp, but
shucks! It’s nothing more than a sort of hotel in
the woods. Some hunters do put up there, but
none of the better sort.</p>

<p>“The gentlemen who own the three camps
you’re going to tried to buy up Hounson’s place,
as they didn’t like him and his crowd around
here, but he wouldn’t sell. That’s where I took
this Jersey man who complained of the cold.
Kept rubbing his ears, and one of ’em was
chawed, just as if some wild critter had him down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and chawed him. ’Course I didn’t say anything
about it, as I thought maybe it might be a tender
subject with him. But I left him at Hounson’s.”</p>

<p>“Did he say what his name was?” asked Tom,
but he only asked to gain time to think over what
he had heard, for he was sure he knew who the
man with the “chawed” ear was.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t tell me his name, and I didn’t
ask him,” Sam said. “Whoa there!” he called
to his horses, for they showed an impatience to
be off.</p>

<p>“Some folks are sort of delicate about giving
out their names,” went on the guide when the
steeds were quieted, “and as I’m a sort of public
character, being the stage driver, when there’s
one to drive, I didn’t feel like going into details.
So I just asked him where he wanted to go, and
he told me. Outside of that, and a little talk
about the weather, him remarking that he come
from Jersey, that’s all the talk we had.</p>

<p>“But maybe you boys know him,” he went on,
as a thought came to him. “He was from Jersey,
and so are you. Do you happen to know who
he is?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t say&mdash;for sure,” spoke Tom,
which was true enough.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you’ll get a chance to see him,”
went on Sam Wilson. “Hounson’s isn’t far from
your first camp, where we’re going to head for in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a minute or so. You could go over there. You
probably will have to, anyhow, if you want your
mail, for the only postoffice for these parts is located
there. And you’ll probably see your man.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, I didn’t take much of a
notion to the feller. He was too sullen and glum-like
to suit me. I like a man to take some interest
in life.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t this man do that?” asked Tom, as he
stowed his gun away on the straw-covered bottom
of the pung.</p>

<p>“Not a cent’s worth!” cried Sam, who was
hearty and bluff enough to suit anyone, and jolly
in the bargain. “This chap sort of wrapped
himself up in one of my fur robes, like one of
them blanket Indians I read about out West, and
he hardly spoke the whole trip. But you’ll probably
see him over at Hounson’s. Well, are you
boys all ready?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” assented Bert, as he slung his
camera over his shoulder by a strap. He hoped
to get a chance at a snapshot.</p>

<p>“Well, then we’ll start,” went on Sam. “Pile
in boys, and wrap them fur robes and blankets
well around your legs. It’s colder riding than it
is walking. So bundle up. It’ll be colder, too,
when we get out of town a ways. We’re in sort
of a holler here, and that cuts off the wind.”</p>

<p>“What about grub?” asked Jack. “Do we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
need to take anything with us? I see a store
over there,” and he indicated one near the small
depot.</p>

<p>“Don’t need to buy a thing,” said Sam.
“Every one of the three camps is well stocked.
There’s bacon, ham, eggs, besides lots of canned
stuff, and I make a trip in to town twice a week.
As for fresh meat, why, you’ll probably shoot all
that you want, I reckon,” and he seemed to take
that as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“Say, look here!” exclaimed Tom, determined
not to sail under false colors, nor have his companions
in the same boat. “We aren’t regular
hunters, you know. This is about the first time
we ever came on a big hunting trip like this, and
maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t say another word!” exclaimed Sam,
good-naturedly. “I understand just how it is.
I’m glad you owned up to it, though,” he went
on, with a twinkle in his blue eyes. “Some fellers
would have tried to bluff it out, but I guess
me and some of the other natives around here,
would have spotted you soon enough.</p>

<p>“But as long as you say you haven’t had much
experience, and as long as you ain’t ashamed of
it, I’ll see that you get plenty of game. I’ll take
you to the best places, and show you how to
shoot.”</p>

<p>“Of course we know how to use guns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
we’ve hunted a little,” Tom said, not wanting it
to appear that they were absolute novices. And
he added: “We’re pretty good shots in a rifle
gallery, too. But it’s different out in the woods.”</p>

<p>“I know!” cried Sam. “I understand. You
don’t need to worry. You won’t starve, if that’s
what’s troubling you. Now I guess we’ll get
along,” and the horses stepped proudly out over
the snowy road. Bells made a merry jingle as
the party of boy hunters started for their first
camp.</p>

<p>“Say, Tom,” spoke Jack in a low voice to his
chum, “do you think that was Skeel, the man with
the ‘chawed’ ear, who was driven over to
Hounson’s?”</p>

<p>“I’m almost sure of it,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Well, what in the world is his object in coming
away up here and at the same time we’re
due?”</p>

<p>“Give it up. We’ll have to look for the answer
later,” was Tom’s reply.</p>

<p>Out on the open road the horses increased their
speed, and soon the pung, under the powerful
pull of the animals, was sliding along at a fast
clip. Much sooner than the boys had expected,
they saw, down in a little valley clearing, a comfortable
looking log-cabin, and at the sight of it
Sam Wilson called out:</p>

<p>“There she is, boys! That’s your first camp!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>THE FIRST HUNT</small></h2>


<p>The pung came to a stop at the head of a
driveway that led up to the log cabin, which was
situated in a little clearing in the dense woods all
about it. Tom and his chums gave one look at
the structure which was to be their home, or one
of them for several weeks, and were about to
leap out of the sled, when Sam stopped them by
a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, boys!” he said. “I want
to take a look there before you step out in the
snow.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Are there traps set
under the drifts?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“No, but it looks to me like someone had been
tramping around that cabin. I never made them
footprints,” and he pointed to some in the snow.</p>

<p>The snow on the driveway, leading from the
main road through the woods, up to the hunting
cabin itself, was not disturbed or broken by the
marks of any sled runners or horses’ hoofs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
There were, however, several lines of human
footprints leading in both directions.</p>

<p>“Just a moment now, boys,” cautioned Sam,
who was following a certain line of footprints,
at the same time stepping in a former line, that
he had evidently made himself, for his boots just
fitted in them.</p>

<p>“What in the world is he doing?” asked
George. “Has anything happened? Has a
crime been committed? Is he looking for evidence?
Why doesn’t he go right up to the
cabin?”</p>

<p>“Any more questions?” asked Jack, as the
other paused for breath. “It seems like old
times, Why, to hear you rattle on in that fashion.”</p>

<p>“Aw&mdash;&mdash;” began George, but that was as far
as he got. Sam was ready now, to make an
announcement.</p>

<p>“I thought so!” exclaimed the guide. “There
has been someone else up here since I left this
morning. Someone has been snooping around
here, and they hadn’t any right to, as this is private
property.”</p>

<p>“Did he get in?” asked Bert, thinking perhaps
all the “grub” might have been taken.</p>

<p>“Don’t seem to have gone in,” replied Sam.
“Whoever it was made a complete circle around
the cabin, though, as if he was looking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
something. You can see the tracks real plain,”
he went on. “Here is where I came up this
morning, to see that everything was all right, for
I expected you boys this afternoon,” he went on.
“And here is where I came back,” and he pointed
out his second line of footprints. “And here is
where Mr. Stranger started up, went around the
cabin, and came out on the main road again,” the
guide resumed. “No, he didn’t get in, but he
looked in the windows all right.”</p>

<p>This the boys could see for themselves, for
they were now out of the pung, there being no
further need of not obliterating the strange footprints.</p>

<p>Tom and his chums noticed where the intruder
had paused beneath several of the low cabin windows,
as though trying to peer inside. And another
thing Tom noticed; in the broad sole-impression
of each boot-mark of the stranger’s feet
was the outline of a star, made in hob nails with
which the soles were studded.</p>

<p>“I’ll know that footprint if I see it again,”
thought Tom. “But I wonder who it was that
was spying around this cabin?”</p>

<p>Sam, however, did not seem to be unduly
alarmed over his discovery. George asked him:</p>

<p>“Who do you s’pose it was that made those
marks?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some stray hunter,” was the answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
“They often get curious, just like a deer, and
come up to see what’s going on. No use getting
mad about it, as long as no harm’s done, and they
didn’t try to get in. Of course, in case of a blizzard,
I wouldn’t find fault if a man took shelter
in one of the cabins, even if he had to break in.
A man’s got a right to save his life.”</p>

<p>“Do you have bad storms up here?” Bert
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I should say we did!” Sam exclaimed, “and
from now on you can count on a storm or a blizzard
’most any day. So watch out for yourselves
and carry a compass with you. But here I am chinning
away when you want to get in and warm up
and tackle the grub. Come on!”</p>

<p>He unlocked the door with a key he carried,
and the boys gazed with interest at the interior
of the shack. It suited them to perfection.</p>

<p>The cabin contained three rather large rooms.
One was the kitchen and dining-room combined,
another was sort of a sitting or living-room, made
comfortable with rugs on the floor, and a fireplace
in which big logs could be burned, while in
the middle of the room was a table covered with
books and magazines. The third room, opening
from the living apartment, was where several
bunks were arranged, and the momentary glimpse
the boys had of them seemed to promise a fine
place to rest at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>A second glance into the kitchen showed a
goodly stock of food. There was a stove, with
a fire laid ready for lighting; and a pile of kindling
and logs on the hearth was also prepared
for ignition. In short, the place was as comfortable
as could be desired, and with a blazing fire
on the hearth, the knowledge that there was
plenty of “grub” in the pantry, and with a blizzard
raging outside, there was little more that
could be desired&mdash;at least, the boys thought that
would be perfect.</p>

<p>“Can you fellows cook?” demanded Sam.</p>

<p>“Well, we can make a stab at it,” answered
Jack.</p>

<p>“We’ve done some camping,” spoke Tom,
modestly enough. “I guess we can get up some
sort of a meal.”</p>

<p>“All right. Then I’ll leave you, for I’ve got
to get back to my farm,” the guide explained.
“Of course there isn’t much to do in the Winter,
but attend to the chores and feed the stock, but
they have to be looked after. I live about seven
miles from here,” he explained, as he brought in
the baggage, guns and cameras. “Now the two
other camps, that go with this one, are several
miles from here, almost in a straight line. There’s
a map showing just how to get to ’em,” he said,
indicating a blueprint drawing on the cabin wall.
“Study that and you won’t get lost. But if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
can’t find the other camps when you want to, I’ll
come and show you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we can manage,” said Tom, who
was getting off his coat preparatory to helping
start the fires and cooking.</p>

<p>“I’ll stop and see you about once in four days,
in case you need anything,” Sam went on. “Just
pin a note to the door of the cabin you last leave,
saying where you’re going, or whether you’re
coming back, so’s I’ll know where to look for you.
My farm is located about half way between Camp
No. 1, that’s this one, and Camp No. 3, which is
the farthest off.</p>

<p>“Well, now if you think you can manage, I’ll
leave you. It’s getting on toward night, and my
folks will be looking for me,” and Sam prepared
to start for home.</p>

<p>“We can get along all right,” Tom assured
him. “And may we begin hunting whenever we
want to?”</p>

<p>“Start in now if you like, but I’d advise waiting
until to-morrow,” the guide said, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll wait,” agreed Jack.</p>

<p>Though the four chums had never been to a
real hunters’ camp before, they had often shifted
for themselves in the woods, or at some lake, and
though they were perhaps not as expert housekeepers
as girls, or women, they managed to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
up a good meal in comparatively short time.</p>

<p>The fire was started in the kitchen stove, and
another blaze was soon roaring up the big chimney
in the living-room. This would take the chill
off the bunk-room, for it was very cold in there,
the windows being covered with a coating of ice.</p>

<p>“Baked beans&mdash;from a can&mdash;bacon and eggs&mdash;coffee
and canned peaches, with bread and butter.
How does that strike you for the first meal?”
asked Tom, who had been looking through the
cupboard.</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Jack. “But what about bread?
If there’s any here, it will be as stale as a rock.”</p>

<p>“Sam had some in the sled. His wife baked
it, I guess,” said Tom, indicating a bundle on
the table. “I found some butter in a jar here.”</p>

<p>“Then start the meal!” cried Bert. “I’m
hungry.”</p>

<p>They all were, and they did ample justice to
the viands that were soon set forth. The cabin
was filled with the appetizing odor of bacon and
coffee, and wagging tongues were momentarily
stilled, for jaws were busy chewing.</p>

<p>Rough and ready, yet sufficiently effective, was
the dish-washing, and then came a comfortable
evening, sitting before the crackling blaze on the
hearth, while they talked over the experiences of
the closing day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>They were all rather sleepy, from the cold wind
they had faced on the sled ride, and soon were
ready to turn in. Just before banking the fire
for the night, Tom paused, and stood in a listening
attitude near one of the windows.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard something,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“He’s worried about the man whose footprints
Sam saw in the snow,” said George.</p>

<p>“Or the man with the ‘chawed’ ear,” added
Bert.</p>

<p>“No, it was the wind, I guess,” Tom spoke.
“But say, fellows, what do you think Skeel is
doing up here?”</p>

<p>“Is he here?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, that ‘chawed’ ear makes it sound so.”</p>

<p>They discussed the matter for some time longer
and then sought the comfortable bunks. Nothing
disturbed them during the night, or if there
were unusual noises the boys did not hear them,
for they all slept soundly.</p>

<p>They awoke to find the sun shining gloriously,
and after breakfast Tom got down his gun, an
example followed by the others.</p>

<p>“Now for a hunt!” he cried. “Some rabbit
stew, or fried squirrel, wouldn’t go half bad.”</p>

<p>“Or a bit of venison or a plump partridge,”
added Jack. “On with the hunt!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</small></h2>


<p>Tom and his chums had no false notions about
their hunting trip. They did not expect much in
the way of big game, though they had been told
that at some seasons bear and deer were plentiful.
But while they had hopes that they might
bag one of those large animals, they were not too
sanguine.</p>

<p>“We’ll stand better chances on deer than
bears,” said Tom. “For the bears are likely to
be ‘holed up’ by now, though there may be one
or two stray ones out that haven’t fatted up
enough to insure a comfortable sleep all Winter.
Of course the deer aren’t like that. They don’t
hibernate.”</p>

<p>“What!” laughed Bert. “Say it again, and
say it slow.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” cried Tom. “You know what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, we might get a brace of fat partridges,
or a couple of rabbits,” Jack said. “I’ll be satisfied
with them for a starter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I know one thing I’m going to get right
now!” exclaimed Bert, with a sudden motion.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything?” demanded Jack,
bringing forward his rifle.</p>

<p>“I’m going to snapshot that view! It’s a
dandy!” Bert went on, as he opened his camera.</p>

<p>“Oh! Only a picture! I thought it was a
bear at least!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>But Bert calmly proceeded to get the view he
wanted. He was perhaps more enthusiastic over
camera work than the others, though they all
liked to dabble in the pastime, and each one had
some fine pictures to his credit.</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re done making snapshots, let’s
go on and do some real shooting,” proposed Jack.</p>

<p>He and Tom each had a rifle, while Bert and
George had shotguns, so they were equipped for
any sort of game they were likely to meet. For
an hour or more they tramped on through the
snow-covered woods, taking care to note their direction
by means of a compass, for they were on
strange ground, and did not want to get lost on
their first hunting trip.</p>

<p>As they came out of a dense patch of scrubby
woods, into a little semi-cleared place, a whirr of
wings startled all of them.</p>

<p>“There they go&mdash;partridges!” yelled Bert,
bringing up his gun and firing quickly.</p>

<p>“Missed!” he groaned a moment later as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
saw the brace of plump birds whirr on without
so much as a feather ruffled.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how to shoot!” grunted
Jack. “You’re not quick enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like to see you shoot anything when
it jumps up right from under your feet, and almost
knocks you over,” was Bert’s defence of
himself.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in George. “I couldn’t
get my gun ready, either, before they were out of
sight.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to be always on the lookout,” said
Tom. “Well, the first miss isn’t so bad. None
of us is in proper shape yet. We’ll get there after
a while.”</p>

<p>A little disappointed at their first failure, the
boys went on again, watching eagerly from side
to side as they advanced. No more did Bert use
his camera. He wanted to make good on a real
shot.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s game here, that’s certain,” said
Tom. “If we can only get it!”</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke there was a whirr at his
very feet. He started back, and half raised his
rifle, not thinking, for the moment, that it was
not a shotgun. Then he cried:</p>

<p>“Bert! George! Quick, wing ’em!”</p>

<p>George was quicker than his companion. Up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to his shoulder went his weapon and the woods
echoed to the shot that followed.</p>

<p>“You got him!” cried Bert, as he saw a bird
flutter to the snow. Bert himself fired at the
second partridge, and had the satisfaction of
knocking off a few feathers, but that was all.
But George, who had not thought to fire his second
barrel, ran forward and picked up the bird
he had bagged. It was a plump partridge.</p>

<p>“That will make part of our meal to-morrow,”
he said, proudly, as he put it in the game bag
Tom carried.</p>

<p>“Say, we’ve struck a good spot all right!” exclaimed
Jack. “It’s up to us now, Tom, to do
something.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” agreed his chum.</p>

<p>But if they expected to have a succession and
continuation of that good luck they were disappointed,
for they tramped on for about three
miles more without seeing anything.</p>

<p>“Better not go too far,” advised Tom. “Remember
that we’ve got to walk back again, and
it gets dark early at this season.”</p>

<p>“Let’s eat grub here and then bear off to the
left,” suggested Jack.</p>

<p>They had brought some sandwiches with them,
and also a coffee pot and tin cups. They found
a sheltered spot, and made a fire, boiling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
coffee which they drank as they munched their
sandwiches.</p>

<p>“This is something like!” murmured Bert, his
mouth half full.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” agreed George. “You
wouldn’t know from looking around here that
there was such a place as Elmwood Hall.”</p>

<p>The meal over, they again took up the march,
and they had not gone far before Tom, who
was a little in advance, started a big white rabbit.
He saw the bunny, and then almost lost sight of
it again, so well did its white coat of fur blend
with the snow. But in another instant Tom’s
keen eye saw it turning at an angle.</p>

<p>He raised his rifle.</p>

<p>“You can’t hit it with that!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>But Tom was a better shot than his chum gave
him credit for being. As the gun cracked, the
rabbit gave a convulsive leap and came down in
a heap on the snow.</p>

<p>“By Jove! You <em>did</em> bag him!” cried Jack,
admiringly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Tom coolly, as though
he had intended doing that all along, whereas he
well knew, as did his chums, that the shot was
pure luck, for it takes a mighty good hunter to get
a rabbit with a rifle bullet.</p>

<p>However, the bunny was added to the game
bag, and then, for some time, the boys had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
further luck. A little later, when they were well
on their way back, Jack saw a plump gray squirrel
on a tree. Bert was near him, but on the
wrong side, and Jack, taking his chum’s gun,
brought down the animal, which further increased
their luck that day.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got all we want to eat for a
while. What do you say we quit?” suggested
Tom. “No use killing just for fun.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed his chums.</p>

<p>“We won’t fire at anything unless it’s a deer
or a bear,” went on Bert, laughing.</p>

<p>As they neared their cabin they were all startled
by a movement in the bush ahead of them.
It sounded as though some heavy body was forcing
its way along.</p>

<p>“There’s a deer&mdash;or bear!” whispered Jack,
raising his rifle.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot at anything you can’t see,” was
Tom’s good advice. And the next moment there
stepped into view of the boys the figure of Professor
Skeel. He was almost as startled on seeing
the four chums as they were at beholding him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>AT CAMP NO. 2</small></h2>


<p>Professor Skeel might well have shrunk back
at the sight which confronted him, for Jack stood
poised, with raised weapon, as though he had it
pointed at the former instructor. But Professor
Skeel did not shrink back. He gazed at the boys,
though there was evidence of surprise on his face.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I beg your pardon,” said Jack, for he
could not forget the time when the crabbed man
had been in authority over him. “I&mdash;I&mdash;didn’t
see you there,” Jack went on.</p>

<p>“Evidently not,” said the man, dryly. “You
had better be careful what you do with a gun.”</p>

<p>“I am careful,” answered Jack, a trifle nettled
at the words and manner of Mr. Skeel. “I
wasn’t going to fire until I saw you.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Mr. Skeel.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I didn’t mean just that,” Jack went on.
“I meant I was going to see what it was before
I shot.”</p>

<p>That was decidedly the better way of putting it.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you are quite a ways from&mdash;from Elmwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Hall,” said Tom, changing from his first
intention of saying “home,” for he recollected
he did not know where Professor Skeel lived.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am up here on&mdash;business,” went on
the unpopular man. “And I trust there aren’t
any hills where you can roll down big snowballs,”
he added significantly.</p>

<p>“You seem to forget that was an accident,”
Tom said. He did not altogether like Professor
Skeel’s tone.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want any accidents like that to
happen up here,” went on the former teacher.
“And now another matter. Are you boys following
me? If you are, I warn you that I will
not tolerate it. You must leave me alone. I have
business to do up here, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We most decidedly are <em>not</em> following you!”
exclaimed Tom, with emphasis. “Besides, we
are on private grounds, the use of which we were
granted for this holiday season, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is that a polite request for me to&mdash;get off?”
asked Mr. Skeel.</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly,” Tom answered. “We
are not the owners, but we have the privilege of
hunting here. It is possible that the caretaker
may order you off. But you have no right to say
that we are following you. We have a right
here.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t <em>say</em> you were&mdash;I only <em>asked</em> if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
were,” said Mr. Skeel, who seemed to “come
down off his high horse a bit,” as Jack said afterward.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll say that you are entirely mistaken,”
went on Tom. “We were out hunting, and we
came upon you unexpectedly. We were as much
surprised as you were, though we guessed you
were in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“You did?” cried Professor Skeel, with sudden
energy. He seemed both startled and angry.
“Who told you?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Sam Wilson, the man who drove you over
from the depot to Hounson’s place,” replied
Tom, who had no reason for concealment, and
who also wanted to show that he knew the whereabouts
of Mr. Skeel.</p>

<p>“I never told him my name!” declared the
former instructor.</p>

<p>Tom did not care to state that they had guessed
the identity of the man by the description of his
injured ear. The member was in plain sight as
Tom looked&mdash;a ragged, torn lobe, of angry-red
color, and it did look, as Sam had said, as though
it had been “chawed by some critter.”</p>

<p>“You seem to know considerable of my affairs,”
went on Mr. Skeel. “But I want to warn
you that I will tolerate no spying on my movements,
and if you try any of your foolish schoolboy
tricks, I shall inform the authorities.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
glared at Tom as he said this, as though challenging
him to make a threat. Doubtless the professor
knew that any charges which might lie
against him in New Jersey would be ineffective
in the Adirondacks. But Tom did not care to
press that matter now.</p>

<p>“You need not fear that we will spy on you,”
said the leader of the young hunters. “And as
for playing tricks, we have something else to do,
Mr. Skeel.”</p>

<p>“Very well; see that you keep to it.”</p>

<p>He turned as though to go away, and, as he
did so the boys saw two other men advancing up
a woodland path toward the professor.</p>

<p>Mr. Skeel made a quick motion toward the
men, exactly, as Bert said afterward, as though
he wanted to warn them back. But either they
did not see, or understand, the warning gestures,
or else they chose to ignore them, for they came
up the inclined snowy path, until they stood in
full view of the four boys. At the sight of one
of the men, Tom uttered an exclamation, that
was echoed by his chums.</p>

<p>“Whalen!” he murmured, recognizing the discharged
employee, for whose dismissal he was,
in a great measure, responsible, since he had made
a report of the man’s cruelty to a young student
at Elmwood Hall.</p>

<p>“We were looking&mdash;&mdash;” began Whalen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
speaking to the professor, when he happened to
recognize the four young hunters, whom he had
evidently failed to notice, as they stood somewhat
in the shadow of a big pine tree, and were well
wrapped up from the cold.</p>

<p>“Never mind now,” said Mr. Skeel, quickly,
as though to keep the man silent. “I was just
going back to you. It seems we are on private
grounds.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of that?” jeered the other man,
who had not yet spoken. He had a brutal, evil
face.</p>

<p>“Lots of it, if you’re not careful,” snapped
Tom, who did not like the fellow’s tone, or manner.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so, young feller? Well, I’d have
you know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man stopped suddenly, for Whalen had
administered a quiet kick, and whispered something
in his ear. What he said the boys could
not hear, but they saw the warning and quieting
chastisement.</p>

<p>“Oh,” and the other man, who had been addressed
as Murker, seemed to swallow the rest
of his words.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Professor Skeel, and without
a further look at the four chums he turned
away, followed by the two men with evil faces.</p>

<p>“Whew! This is going some!” gasped Jack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
when the trio was out of sight. “Who’d think
of meeting Skeel and those two worthies up here
in the wilderness?”</p>

<p>“Well, we practically knew Skeel was here,”
said Bert, “though we aren’t any nearer than we
were in guessing at what his object is. But it is
a surprise to see Whalen and that other man,
whoever he is. They must be trailing in with
Skeel. What’s the game, Tom?”</p>

<p>Tom Fairfield did not answer for a moment.
He was busy looking at some tracks in the snow.</p>

<p>“Yes, they are just the same,” he murmured,
slowly.</p>

<p>“What is it? A bear?” asked George, eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, but look,” and Tom pointed to some
footprints. In the middle of the sole of each one
was a star made in hob nails.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, that’s the same mark that was
near our cabin,” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” Tom agreed coolly. “I thought it
would prove so.”</p>

<p>“But what does it all mean?” asked Bert.
“What are they doing up here, and around our
cabin?”</p>

<p>“Give it up,” spoke Tom. “Maybe they’re
hunting, as we are.”</p>

<p>“But they had no guns,” Jack said.</p>

<p>“No. Well, we’ll just have to wait and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
what turns up,” Tom went on. “I think we gave
’em rather a surprise, though.”</p>

<p>“We sure did,” agreed George. “But that
Whalen surprised me, too. I wonder how he
got here?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you say you told him where we were
coming?” Tom asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, after he pumped me with a lot of
questions. I didn’t realize what I was doing.
I say, Tom, I hope I haven’t done any harm!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. There wasn’t any secret about
where we were going to spend the Christmas holidays,”
Tom said. “But it is rather odd to find
those three so close after us. But maybe it will
be all right. They know they are on private preserves&mdash;our
private grounds&mdash;for the time being,
and I guess they won’t trouble us.”</p>

<p>“Then it was those three, sneaking around the
cabin?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Professor Skeel, at least,” Tom went on,
“though it may have been only ordinary curiosity
that took him there. We’ll take a little
trip over to Hounson’s some day, and see what
we can pick up there.”</p>

<p>It was getting late, so the young hunters made
haste back to their cabin. They had supper, and
then once more sat about the fire and talked
through the long Winter evening. The next day
they dressed their game and cooked it, finding it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a welcome relief from the canned meats and
bacon on which they had been living.</p>

<p>The rest of that week they remained in the vicinity
of Cabin No. 1, having fair luck, but getting
no big game. They saw one deer, but missed
him. In this time they saw no more of Skeel or
his cronies.</p>

<p>“What do you say we go over to Camp No. 2
for a change?” asked Tom, one night.</p>

<p>“We’re with you,” his chums agreed, and they
made an early start, through the woods, locking
up the place they left behind, for they might not
be back for several days. They managed to bag
several rabbits and squirrels on their march, but
saw no signs of deer. Sam had told them they
might not have much luck in this direction.</p>

<p>In due time, by following a copy of the blue
print map they had made, they came to Camp No.
2. There had been a light fall of snow in the
night, and as Tom approached the cabin, he cried
out:</p>

<p>“Boys, they’ve been here ahead of us!” He
pointed to footprints in the white blanket&mdash;footprints,
one of which had a star in the middle of
the sole.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>MORE PLOTTING</small></h2>


<p>Impetuous George Abbot was about to rush
forward when Tom, stretching out a hand, held
him back.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” he said, and there was
some strange quality in Tom’s voice that made
his chum obey.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he asked, glancing from Tom
to the cabin.</p>

<p>“Nothing yet, but there may be,” was the cool
answer.</p>

<p>“You mean there may be someone in that
cabin&mdash;Skeel or those other men?”</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it,” Tom said.</p>

<p>“That’s right&mdash;best to be on the safe side,”
put in Bert. “Those men, or Skeel, especially,
have been here lately.”</p>

<p>“But they haven’t any right in our cabin&mdash;at
least the cabin your friends gave us the use of,
Tom,” objected George.</p>

<p>“I know they haven’t, and that’s just where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the trouble might come in. Those two men with
Skeel look like ugly customers. If we cornered
them in a cabin they had no right to enter, they
might turn ugly. It’s best to go a bit slowly until
we find out whether or not they are in there.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” chimed in Jack. “Not
that I’m afraid, but I don’t want to run into
trouble so early on our vacation. Of course it’s
possible,” he went on, “that someone else besides
Skeel and his cronies may have been here, or may
still be here, for boots, with nail-marks like those
on the sole, can’t be so very rare. But I’m inclined
to think Skeel wore those,” and he nodded
toward the marks in the snow.</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” Tom said, “and we’ll soon
find out. Let’s look about a bit before we rush
up to the cabin,” he went on.</p>

<p>Slowly the boys circled about it, gradually coming
closer, to give those within, if such unwarranted
visitors there might be, a chance to either
make their presence known in a friendly manner,
or take their departure.</p>

<p>But there was no sign from the cabin of Camp
No. 2, and, after waiting a little while, Tom and
his chums moved forward. As they came nearer,
they could see that some two or three persons had
made a complete circle about the cabin, and had
even advanced up on the rough steps that led to
the front door. Whether they had entered or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
not was something that could not be stated with
positiveness.</p>

<p>“Well, the door’s locked, anyhow,” Tom said,
as he looked at the padlock. “But of course
they might have a duplicate key.” He drew from
his pocket the one Sam Wilson had given him,
and a moment later Tom and his chums stood
inside the cabin. They breathed a sigh of relief.
No one opposed them.</p>

<p>Nor, as far as could be learned by a glance
around the interior, had any uninvited guests
been present. The place was in order, not as
complete, perhaps as that of the first camp, but
enough to show that it had been “slicked up,”
after its last occupancy by the hunting party of
gentlemen to whom Tom and his friends were
indebted for the use of the camps.</p>

<p>“Skeel and his cronies may have been here all
the same, looking for us,” said Jack, as he stood
his gun in a corner.</p>

<p>“Why should they be looking for us?” inquired
George.</p>

<p>“Now don’t start that list of questions,” objected
Jack. “Ask Tom.”</p>

<p>George turned a gaze on his other chum.</p>

<p>“Of course Skeel may have been here,” admitted
our hero. “We were never in this cabin
before, and we don’t know how it looked, or how
it was arranged. But if they were here, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
don’t seem to have done much damage, and if
they had a meal, they washed the dishes up after
them.”</p>

<p>A look in the kitchen showed that it was in
order. This cabin was built just the same as was
No. 1, and the arrangements and furnishings
were practically similar.</p>

<p>“Well, Skeel or no Skeel, I’m going to have
something to eat!” cried Tom. “Come on, fellows,
make yourselves at home.”</p>

<p>This they proceeded to do, making arrangements
to get a meal, for there was plenty of wood
for the stove as well as a pile of dry logs for the
fireplace. A blaze was not unwelcome, for it was
growing colder, and there were signs of a storm.</p>

<p>As our friends sat about the cozy, crackling
blaze on the hearth they were unaware of three
men, on the edge of the little clearing in which
the cabin stood&mdash;three men who were gazing at
the smoke curling up from the chimney.</p>

<p>“Yes, there they are!” grumbled the one
known as Whalen. “There they are in their
cabin, nice and warm, and with plenty to eat, and
we’re out in the cold. I don’t like it, I say! I
don’t like it!”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t get rash!” observed Professor
Skeel, for he was of the trio. “What is a little
discomfort now compared to the satisfaction
we’ll have later?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind so much, if I was sure of
that,” said Whalen sullenly. “But it ain’t noways
sure.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it sure,” said the hoarse voice of the
other plotter.</p>

<p>“Have you decided on a way to get him into
our hands?” asked the former teacher eagerly.
“Have you a plan, Murker?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a good one, too!” was the answer.
“It’s come to me since we’ve been fiddling around
here.”</p>

<p>“And can we get him&mdash;get Tom Fairfield&mdash;where
we want him?” asked Professor Skeel eagerly.
“That’s what I want to know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we can,” answered Murker, an
unpleasant grin spreading over his evil face. “I
haven’t all the details worked out yet, but when
I get through, I think we’ll have him just where
we want him. Not that I want him particularly,”
he went on. “I never knew him before you fellows
got me into this,” and when he classed Professor
Skeel as a “fellow,” the latter did not
object.</p>

<p>It showed to what depths the really talented
man had fallen. For Professor Skeel was a brilliant
scholar, and would have made his mark in
educational circles, had he chosen to be honest.
But he took the easiest way, which ends by being
the hardest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t ask you to take any interest in Tom
Fairfield, once you help me get him in my power,”
went on the former instructor. “I’ll attend to
the rest. But I want him alone. I don’t want
to have to handle any of the others.”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” exclaimed Whalen.
“We’ll have our hands full, if we try to take
care of all four of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t be afraid,” was the sneering
comment of Murker. “I guess we could persuade
’em to be good,” and he leered at his companions.</p>

<p>“Four are too many to handle,” decided Professor
Skeel. “I want Tom Fairfield alone.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll get him for you,” promised Murker.
“But you’ve got to give me a share of the ransom
money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do that,” readily agreed the former
teacher. “I’m doing this as much to square accounts
with him as for anything else.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not working for love&mdash;or revenge,”
chuckled Murker. “I want the cold
cash.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” chimed in Whalen, “but I want
revenge, too. It’s going to be a regular kidnapping,
isn’t it?” and he looked at Professor Skeel.</p>

<p>“It will be if he can carry it out,” was the
answer, with a nod at Murker.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do my part,” was the assurance given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“But won’t it be risky&mdash;dangerous?” asked
Whalen. “I don’t want to get in trouble,” and
he looked rather anxiously about him, as though
already he feared officers of the law might be
after him.</p>

<p>“There’s no more risk for you than for us,”
spoke Professor Skeel.</p>

<p>“There won’t be any risk&mdash;not up in this lonesome
place,” Murker said.</p>

<p>“But how are you going to make sure of getting
Tom into our hands alone?” asked the rascally
professor.</p>

<p>“Leave that to me,” was the chuckling answer.
“I used to live in this region when I was a young
fellow. Folks have forgotten me, but I haven’t
forgotten them.”</p>

<p>“I say!” exclaimed Professor Skeel, “I hope
you’re not going to bring any more into this. The
more there are the more risk there is, and the
money I expect to get from Mr. Fairfield, for
giving Tom back to him, won’t go so far if we
have to split it up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry! No one else but us three
will be in it. I should have said I hadn’t forgotten
the country up around here&mdash;not so much the
people. I don’t care anything about them. But
I know every cross-road and bridle-path through
the woods, and it will be funny if I can’t get this
lad where I want him. They’re strangers up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
here, and they have to depend on signposts, and
what that guide tells them.”</p>

<p>“But they are smart fellows,” said Professor
Skeel. “I know, for I taught them in school.
If they have a signboard to go by, it will be as
good to them as a printed book would be to most
people.”</p>

<p>“That may all be very true,” chuckled Murker.
“But tell me this. A wrong signboard isn’t
much use to anyone, is it? Not even to a smart
lad.”</p>

<p>“A wrong signboard? What do you mean?”
asked the professor.</p>

<p>“I mean just what I said&mdash;‘a wrong signboard’&mdash;one
that gives the wrong direction.
It’s worse than none at all, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say it was,” was the slow answer
of the former teacher. “But are you going
to get Tom Fairfield&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t ask too many questions,” was the
advice of his evil-faced crony. “When you don’t
know a thing, you can say so with a clear conscience
in case the detectives get asking too many
personal questions of you.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Professor Skeel, readily
understanding what was meant.</p>

<p>“Detectives!” exclaimed Whalen. “Did you
say detectives?</p>

<p>“But&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;they&mdash;I don’t want to see any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
detectives,” stammered the former employee of
Elmwood Hall.</p>

<p>“I don’t either,” chuckled Murker. “But it’s
best to be on the safe side, and to prepare for
emergencies. So what you and the professor
don’t know, you can’t tell. Leave the details to
me, and I’ll fix ’em. Now I think we’ve been here
long enough. We know what we came over to
this cabin to find out&mdash;that they hadn’t been here
before until just now. And we’re pretty certain
they’ll go next&mdash;to No. 3 Camp.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Whalen.</p>

<p>“Because boys are like deer at times&mdash;mighty
curious. They won’t rest satisfied until they’ve
tried all three camps. They’ll go over to the last
one in a few days, and then, Skeel, we may have
Tom Fairfield just where we want him!”</p>

<p>“I hope so!” was the fervent exclamation, as
the three plotters made their way off through the
dense woods.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>A LUCKY SHOT</small></h2>


<p>“Well, we’re not going to stay in all the rest
of the day, are we?” asked Jack Fitch, pushing
back his chair from the table.</p>

<p>“I should say not!” exclaimed Bert. “There’s
plenty of time yet to go out and bag a deer or
two.”</p>

<p>“Nothing small about you,” chuckled Tom, as
he looked to his ammunition. “But I agree that
there’s no use wasting time indoors. It does
look like a storm, so we won’t go too far away
from the cabin.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to stay here to-night?” asked
George.</p>

<p>“Sure,” remarked Tom. “It’s too far to
tramp back to No. 1 Camp. This is just as well
stocked up, and as there are plenty of bedclothes
here, and lots of wood, we don’t care how cold
it gets outside.”</p>

<p>They had finished their meal, and it was now
early in the afternoon. It would soon be dark,
however, for in December the days are very short.
But, as Jack had said, the few remaining hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of daylight need not be wasted, and as yet the
boys had not bagged any big game.</p>

<p>“It’s too dark for photographs,” suggested
George, as he saw Bert getting out his camera.</p>

<p>“Not if I make a few as soon as I get out,”
was the answer. “I want to get some views
around this camp.”</p>

<p>A close search through the cabin had not revealed
that Skeel and his companions had entered.
The boys felt sure it was those men who
had made the tracks in the snow about the little
building. But, if they had entered, nothing had
been unduly disturbed.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what their game was,” spoke
Jack, as he shouldered his gun and followed Tom
and the others outside.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> sort of a puzzle,” our hero agreed.
“We’ll have to take a walk over to Hounson’s
some day this week, and see what we can learn.
If those fellows think they can trespass all over
these camps it’s time we told Sam Wilson. He’ll
send them flying, I’ll wager!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” declared Bert.</p>

<p>The boys followed a trail through the woods.
Their friend, the guide and caretaker of the
camps, had told them about it, advising them to
follow it, as they might see some game along it.
This they were now hoping for, keeping a bright
lookout in every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>As they tramped along, the sudden rattle of a
dried bush on the right of Tom attracted his
attention. He looked in time to see a white
streak darting along.</p>

<p>“A rabbit!” he cried and fired on the instant.</p>

<p>“Missed!” yelled Bert, as the echoes of the
shot died away.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t!” cried Tom. “You’ll find him
behind that stump.”</p>

<p>And, surely enough, when the other boys
looked, there was the rabbit neatly bagged. He
was needed for food, too, for they had no fresh
meat at this camp, and already they were beginning
to tire of the canned variety.</p>

<p>Except for the determination to each bring
back a deer’s head, and the pelt of a bear, our
four boy hunters had made up their minds not
to be wanton shots. They wanted to get enough
game for food, and the head and skin for relics,
after using such of the meat as they needed of
the bear and deer.</p>

<p>“Of course we four can’t eat all that meat in
the short while we’ll be in the woods,” Tom said,
“but we can give it to Sam, so it won’t be
wasted.”</p>

<p>Tom and his chums had the right idea of hunting,
and had no desire to slaughter for the mere
savage joy of killing.</p>

<p>“Another rabbit and a few partridges and we’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
have enough to keep the kitchen going the rest
of the week,” Bert said, as Tom put the bunny
in his bag. “Then all we’ll have to look for will
be a bear or a deer.”</p>

<p>But even small game was scarce, it seemed, and
though several shots were tried at rabbits at a
distance, and though some partridges were
flushed, no further luck resulted.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk when Tom suggested that
they had better return to camp, and they retraced
their steps. However, the rabbit was a large one,
and, made into either a stew or potpie, would
provide the main dish for their next day’s
dinner.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the boys were on the
move again. They hunted around the cabin,
planning to come back to it at noon for the hot
rabbit dinner, and this they did.</p>

<p>The only luck they had was that Bert and
George got some fine photographs. But not a
rabbit nor a bird fell to their guns that day. Tom
scared up a fox, and took several shots at it,
hoping he might carry home the skin. But if
Reynard were hit he showed no signs of it, and
went bounding on through the woods.</p>

<p>“We’ll make a regular hunt of it to-morrow,”
decided Tom, as they sat about the cheerful fire
in the cabin that night. “We’ll get an early
start, take our lunch, a pot to make some coffee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
over an open fire, and we won’t come back until
dark.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” cried Bert.</p>

<p>“This is the best hunting ground, according to
what Sam said,” Tom went on, “and we want to
put in our best licks here. So we’ll take a whole
day to it, and go as far as we can, working north,
I think, as the woods seem to be thicker there.”</p>

<p>This met with the approval of the others, and
they started out the next morning, equipped for
staying several hours in the open. They set out
on a new trail, one they had not traveled before,
but they had not gone far on it before Tom, who
was in the lead, came to a sudden halt, and uttered
an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called Jack, who was
directly behind him. “See some bear tracks?”</p>

<p>“No, these are Skeel tracks, I should say.
Those fellows must be just ahead of us, for the
marks seem quite fresh.”</p>

<p>Tom pointed to some impressions in the snow.
Among them were footprints showing that same
star mark in hob nails.</p>

<p>“I wonder why they’re trailing and following
us?” remarked Bert. “It can’t be just for fun.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they don’t know where to look for
game, and are depending on us,” suggested
George.</p>

<p>“That might be so,” agreed Tom. “But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
wish they’d show their hands, and not keep us
guessing all the while. It’s getting on my
nerves.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll keep a lookout for ’em now,”
suggested Bert, “and if we see ’em, we’ll give
’em a bit of our minds.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’m going to ask Sam Wilson to
tell ’em to go,” added Tom. “They haven’t any
right here. They may be scaring all the game
away, and besides, it’s risky. They may get in
the way of our guns, or we come too close to
theirs, though I haven’t seen them with either a
rifle or a shotgun yet.”</p>

<p>“No they don’t seem to be hunting, but if they
aren’t, what in the world are they up here for?”
asked Bert.</p>

<p>“That’s what gets me,” remarked Jack.
“Well, come on. Time’s too valuable to waste
in chinning.”</p>

<p>Once more they took up the trail. The footsteps
of the three men, on their mysterious errand,
crossed the path of our friends at an angle, and
they did not think it wise to follow the marks of
the hob nails.</p>

<p>Luck seemed to be better to-day, from the very
start, for, before they had gone three miles, they
had bagged two rabbits, three squirrels and Jack
had a partridge to his credit.</p>

<p>“Enough to keep us from starving,” he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
“Now for bigger game&mdash;a deer, at least.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to get a good deer picture,” announced
Bert, looking to see that his camera was
in working order.</p>

<p>A little later the four boys stood in a small
clearing in the woods, wondering which way to go
next, for, so far, they had seen no signs of either
bear or deer. They hoped it was not so late in
the season that all the bears would be enjoying
their winter sleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a slight noise over in the
underbrush to the left of the clearing.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see what that is!” cried Bert,
starting forward with his camera.</p>

<p>“Probably nothing but a rabbit,” said Jack.
“And we’ve got enough of the bunnies.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take a snapshot; that won’t hurt,”
Bert responded.</p>

<p>The others, not much interested, watched him.
Softly he went forward, hoping he might get a
picture of a rabbit in its native woodland. The
sun was just right for a picture.</p>

<p>But, as Bert looked, a deer suddenly came out
of the brush, and stood on the edge of the clearing,
seemingly unconscious of the presence of the
boys. They had seen the beautiful creature, however,
and for the moment none of them raised
his rifle. Bert’s, indeed, was slung on his back
out of the way while he used his camera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Without speaking, Bert motioned to his chums
not to shoot until he had a chance to make a picture.
Tom and the others signified that they
would hold their fire.</p>

<p>Bert crept up, the deer still unconscious of the
presence of its enemies, and the youth soon had
the animal in focus. It looked as though it would
be a fine photograph.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was another crashing sound in
the bushes, and as the boys, startled, turned, they
saw a larger deer, with sharp, branching antlers,
step from cover just behind Bert. The latter
was so intent on getting the photograph that he
did not turn to see how he was menaced from
the rear.</p>

<p>The male deer, with a snort and a stamping
of hoofs, and with lowered head, leaped toward
Bert. The animal, evidently thinking its mate in
danger, was going to her defense.</p>

<p>“Look out, Bert!” cried Jack, but the warning
would have come too late. Bert did not even
turn around, for he was on the point of pressing
the shutter release of his camera. He had noticed
a slight movement on the part of the female
deer that indicated she was about to leap into the
bushes.</p>

<p>“There, I’ve got you!” cried Bert, as he
pressed the bulb.</p>

<p>The next instant he was startled by a snort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
behind him. He heard a rattle of hoofs, and
the voices of his chums crying a warning.</p>

<p>Bert turned to run, but he would not have been
in time, except for what happened. A lucky shot
on the part of Tom probably saved his friend
from severe injury, if not death.</p>

<p>With a sudden motion <a href="#image01">Tom</a> threw his rifle to
his shoulder, <a href="#image01">took quick aim, and fired</a>.</p>

<p>The male deer went down in a heap, actually
turning a somersault, so great was its speed.
And it came to rest, breathing its last, almost at
Bert’s feet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE CHANGED SIGN</small></h2>


<p>“Say, that <em>was</em> a shot!”</p>

<p>“That’s what! Just in time, too!”</p>

<p>Thus cried Jack and George. Bert was too
surprised to utter a word, and Tom was too
anxious to make sure he had bagged the first
specimen of real game since coming to camp.</p>

<p>But there was no mistake about it. There lay
the slain deer, and a fine specimen it was. The
one Bert had photographed with his camera had,
on the first alarm, darted into the underbrush,
and was now far away, doubtless wondering
what had happened to her mate.</p>

<p>“Say, why didn’t you fellows tell me what was
going on?” asked Bert, as he whirled about and
saw what had happened.</p>

<p>“We did,” spoke George.</p>

<p>“There came pretty nearly not being time
enough to do anything,” went on Jack. “It was
touch and go, Bert, old man. Tom, here, fired
just in time.”</p>

<p>“Was it really as close as that?” asked the
lad with the camera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“It certainly was,” Jack assured him. “That
deer had it in for you. I guess he thought you
were trying to pot his mate with a new-fangled
gun, and he made up his mind to stop you.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tom stopped him all right,” spoke
George. “Say, it’s a fine specimen!” and he
gazed admiringly at the head and horns. “It
will make a fine trophy for your room, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking so much of that when I
fired,” was the modest answer. “I was wondering
whether I could bowl him over before he
reached Bert with those business-looking horns.”</p>

<p>“And you did, old man. I shan’t forget
that!” exclaimed Bert, fervently. “I’ll do as
much for you some day, only I’m not as good a
shot as you, so don’t take any chances. If a deer
or a bear comes after you, run first, and get in a
safe place. Then wait for me to shoot at it.”</p>

<p>“It was more luck than anything else that I
got him,” Tom said. “If I had stopped to think,
I’m sure I’d have had a touch of ‘buck-fever,’
and I wouldn’t have been able to hold my gun
steady. But I just up and blazed away.”</p>

<p>“Well, now we’ve got it, what are we going
to do with it?” asked Jack. “Shall we trail
after the one that got away&mdash;the one Bert took
a picture of?”</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” asked Bert. “She’s miles
away from here now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides,” added Tom, “we’ve got more meat
here now than we can use in a week. No use
killing for fun. I’ve got the head trophy I want,
and it will be the turn of you fellows next. I
won’t shoot any more deer, though I’ll bag a
bear if I can. We don’t want to shoot female
deer if we can help it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jack. “Now let’s decide
what to do about this fellow. He’s a big
one, and will take some cutting-up.”</p>

<p>The boys were rather dubious about getting
the deer’s head off, and taking the best part for
food. But they were saved what might have
been an unpleasant task by the arrival of Sam
Wilson.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried the guide, as he saw his young
friends. “Well, you have had some luck, haven’t
you! Is that your first one?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Tom, as he related what had
occurred.</p>

<p>“Well, now, that’s the way to do!” Sam cried.
“He’s a fine critter, too; good head and horns.
I’ve got my pung just outside on the road. I’ll
take him along, dress him for you and send the
head to an Indian to be mounted. Old Wombo
does pretty good work that way.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would have it done,” Tom said.
“And take some of the venison yourself. There’s
more than we can use.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides, we’re going to get more deer in a
few days,” added George.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are, eh? Well, nothing like being
sure,” chuckled the old guide and hunter. “So
far, though, you’ve done as well as the men who
come up here, so I wouldn’t wonder but what
you’d beat ’em. How have you been? Anything
happened?”</p>

<p>They told of their experiences in camp, and
Tom mentioned Skeel and his cronies.</p>

<p>“Trespassing on these preserves, eh?” exclaimed
Sam. “Well, I’ll have to look into that.
These lands are posted, and only those who get
permission can enter on them, and hunt or fish.
I’ll just put a flea in the ears of those fellows,
if they don’t look out!”</p>

<p>With the help of the boys, Sam carried the deer
out to his waiting pung. He said he had happened
to pass near No. 2 Camp, and decided to
run in on the chance that the boys might be
there.</p>

<p>The deer’s legs were tied together, and then a
long pole, cut from the woods, was thrust between
them, lengthwise. On the shoulders of the boys
and the guide the carcass was taken out to the
big sled.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring the meat over to-morrow,” promised
Sam, “and the head will be mounted later.
It takes a little time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Keep plenty of the venison yourself,” Tom
urged.</p>

<p>“Well, just as you say,” was the laughing acceptance.
“I haven’t had much chance to do
any hunting yet. I’m glad you had a good start
of luck.”</p>

<p>“And I hope my picture of the other deer
comes out all right,” murmured Bert, his interest,
just then, centering in his camera.</p>

<p>“Well, if it hadn’t been for Tom, you might
not have come out all right,” said Jack, more than
half seriously.</p>

<p>That was the extent of their luck for that day,
however, except that both Bert and George secured
some fine snapshots. When Sam had departed
with the slain deer, the boys found a good
place to stop, and build a fire to make coffee.
They ate their lunch with such appetites as come
only from life in the open, and, having finished,
once more they set out on the trail.</p>

<p>But, though Jack, Bert and George each hoped
for a repetition of Tom’s luck, in some modified
form, it was not to be.</p>

<p>The boy hunters adopted all the suggestions of
Sam, in looking for more game, but though they
saw signs of it, the game itself had disappeared,
at least for the time being.</p>

<p>“But we’ve got other days ahead of us,” suggested
Tom. “We don’t have to go back for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
more than two weeks, and that will give us plenty
of chances.”</p>

<p>They reached Camp No. 2 very tired, but satisfied
with their day’s trip. And they brought with
them appetites that made Jack, who was temporarily
doing the cooking, wish his chums had left
part of their hunger in the woods.</p>

<p>“What! More beans?” he cried to Bert, who
passed his plate for the third time. “Can’t you
eat anything but beans?”</p>

<p>“Don’t need to, when they’re cooked as good
as this, old man,” was the laughing answer.
“That molasses you put in just gave ’em the right
flavor.”</p>

<p>“I’ll leave it out next time,” grumbled Jack.
“I want a chance to get a bite myself.”</p>

<p>The meal went merrily on, and then came a
delightful evening spent in the flickering blaze of
the log fire, talking over the events of the day.
Bert had developed his picture of the deer, and
found that it would make a good print. Tom
was dreaming of the time when he would get
back the mounted head to hang on the wall of
his den at home, as a memento of the trip.</p>

<p>Tom was destined to have other memories of
the trip than his deer-head trophy, but he did not
know that yet.</p>

<p>A rather heavy fall of snow the next day prevented
the boys from going far from the cabin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
for they did not want to take any chances on being
lost in the storm.</p>

<p>There was no need to go out for food, as they
had plenty, and in the afternoon Sam came over
with a generous supply of deer meat, so their
larder was well supplied.</p>

<p>“When are we going to take in Camp No. 3?”
asked Jack of Tom, when Sam had gone back
home in his pung sled.</p>

<p>“Well, we can go over there whenever you
fellows want to. I don’t believe, from what Sam
says, that it’s quite as good hunting ground as
this, and I thought maybe you’d want to stay
here until you each got a deer’s head.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess that would be best,” agreed Bert.
“This seems to be the most promising location.
And there may be bears around. I heard some
animal prowling about the cabin last night.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” confessed George. “Maybe it
was Skeel and his crowd,” he added.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” scoffed Tom. “More like it was
a fox looking to pick up something to eat that
we had thrown out. But we’ll stay around here
for a few days longer, and then make a hike for
No. 3. We might as well take ’em all in while
we’re here. No telling when we’ll get another
chance.”</p>

<p>Had the boys known what was in store for
them, they would have started for No. 3 Camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
at once. But they did not know, and the delay
gave the enemies of Tom Fairfield a chance to
plan their trick.</p>

<p>For the next day, at some distance from No.
2 Cabin, there might have been seen three men,
going along the snow-covered forest trail, in a
manner that could only be described as “slinking.”
A glance would have disclosed their
identities&mdash;Skeel, Whalen and Murker.</p>

<p>“Think they’ll soon be on the move?” asked
Professor Skeel. “If they don’t take the trail,
all our work will be wasted.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got to take <em>some</em> chances,”
growled Murker. “If this dodge doesn’t fool
’em, I’ll have to try another. But I think it will.
Once we get ’em confused, and off the road, we
can separate ’em by some means or other, and
deal with Fairfield alone. You leave it to me.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” assented Professor Skeel.</p>

<p>A little farther walk through the woods
brought the three conspirators to a cross-road.
It was not much traveled in Winter, but in Summer
formed a popular highway. The main road
led back to the village, where the boys had left
the railroad train, and the cross highway connected
two towns&mdash;Ramsen and Fayetville.</p>

<p>Reaching this signboard, Murker looked
around to make sure he was unobserved. Then,
with a few blows from a hammer, he knocked off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the two signboards. These he reversed, so that
the one marked “Seven miles to Ramsen” pointed
in just the opposite direction&mdash;to Fayetville.
The other board he also reversed.</p>

<p>“But it’s the Ramsen one they’ll look at if
they come to Camp No. 3,” said Murker, “and
they’re almost sure to come. Then we’ll have
Fairfield where we want him!”</p>

<small>THE BEAR’S TRAIL</small></h2>


<p>Bert Wilson was carefully examining his
camera, sitting at a table in the cozy quarters of
Cabin No. 2, where he and his chums had gathered
after the day’s hunt. When he had adjusted
the shutter, which had stuck several times of late,
thereby spoiling some fine pictures, Bert took up
his gun, and began taking that apart to clean it.</p>

<p>“I say! What’s up?” questioned Tom, who
was lying lazily on his back on a blanket-covered
couch, staring at the flicker of the flames on the
ceiling. “Getting ready for an expedition,
Bert?”</p>

<p>“Well, I sort of feel it in my bones that I’ll
get a bear to-morrow, or a deer anyhow, and I’m
taking no chances,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Going to get the game with your gun or your
camera?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Both,” was the quick answer. “I’ll snapshot
him first and pot him afterward.”</p>

<p>“If he lets you,” laughed George. “But I’d
like to see any healthy bear stand for having Bert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
poke a camera in his face, and then shoot a slug
of lead into him.”</p>

<p>“You watch my smoke&mdash;that’s all,” said Bert
significantly, as he went on cleaning his gun.</p>

<p>“What’s the program for to-morrow?” asked
Jack, who, like Tom, was doing nothing, and
taking considerable pains at it.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought we’d go off on an all-day
hunt again,” was the young host’s answer, for
Tom was really in that position, it being on his
invitation, through his father, that the boys had
come to the hunting camp.</p>

<p>“That idea suits me,” responded Jack. “But
take along more grub than we did last time. I
was hungry before we got back.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t we shoot what we want to eat?”
suggested George. “I never read of a party of
hunters having to depend on canned stuff or the
grocery when they were really good shots, as we
are!” and he puffed himself up with pretended
pride. “What’s the use taking a lot of grub
along when you can shoot a partridge or two,
and broil ’em over the coals of an open fire?
Doesn’t that sound good?”</p>

<p>“It <em>sounds</em> a great deal better than it really
is,” spoke Tom. “That sort of thing is all right
to read about, but I like my game to stand a little
after being killed. And it’s hard to dress and
get ready anything when you’re on a tramp. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
I think we’ll just take our grub along. We’ll
have more time for hunting then.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented Jack.</p>

<p>Bert’s interest in his gun prompted George to
look after his weapon. Jack and Tom declared
theirs were already in perfect shape for the morrow’s
sport, providing they saw any game.</p>

<p>“I do wish we’d spot a bear,” said Jack, with
an envious sigh.</p>

<p>“Not much chance of that,” came from Tom.
“I asked Sam about that, and he said while bears
were plentiful in this part of the Adirondacks, at
certain seasons, this wasn’t exactly the time for
them. They’re probably in their caves, or hollow
logs, waiting for Candlemas Day, to come out and
look for their shadows.”</p>

<p>“Do you really believe in that superstition&mdash;that
if a bear, or a ground hog, does see his shadow
on that day, there’ll be six weeks more of
Winter, and if he doesn’t, there won’t?” asked
George.</p>

<p>“There you go again&mdash;shooting questions at
us!” laughed Tom. “No, I don’t believe it, but
lots of folks do.”</p>

<p>“Did Sam say anything about the chances for
getting more deer?” Bert wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, he admitted there were plenty this
year. But I’ve shot mine, so I’m not interested,”
Tom said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m counting on a bear-skin rug to put in
front of my bed,” remarked Jack. “Then when
I have to jump up in the cold, I can warm my
feet before I start to dress.”</p>

<p>“Nothing like comfort,” spoke Bert. “Going
to have your bear’s skin tanned with the head on,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I will.”</p>

<p>“Better get your bear first,” said Tom grimly.
“Well, let’s lay out plans for to-morrow’s hunt.
What trail shall we take? I rather fancy, from
what Sam said, that the old lumber road will be
best to start on. Maybe we can make Camp No.
3 in the day’s tramp, and do some hunting along
the way.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather too much of a risk, isn’t it?”
asked Jack. “We could easily make Camp No.
3 in a day’s tramp, if we started out from here
early enough, and didn’t waste any time following
game trails. But if we try to do any hunting,
we’re likely to be delayed. Then we won’t be
able to start for camp until late. We may not
reach it, and not be able to get back here and
then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried Tom. “Have you any
more if and but calamities up your sleeve, old
man? If you have, trot ’em out. We can make
Camp No. 3 all right, and do some hunting, too.
Why, it’s a good trail once we get over the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and strike the road to Ramsen. That’s what
Sam said.”</p>

<p>Tom spoke of going over the mountain, but
what he meant was going over the ridge of the
highest range which they were then among. For
the mountains were all around them, differing in
height and rugged appearance only.</p>

<p>“Well, go ahead and let’s try it, then,” said
Jack, with a shrug of his shoulders. “And if
anything happens, don’t blame me!”</p>

<p>“We won’t, as long as you don’t say ‘I told
you so!’” exclaimed Bert. “That always makes
me mad.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;let it go at that,” suggested Tom.
“Then we’ll take as much time as we want for
hunting to-morrow, and strike for Camp No. 3
when we feel like it. We’ll take along some
grub, and make coffee as usual. That sounds
good.”</p>

<p>“And I do hope I get a bear&mdash;or deer,” murmured
Bert. “If I don’t I’m going to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hark!” suddenly interrupted Tom. He sat
up quickly, in a listening attitude on the couch.</p>

<p>“Nothing but the wind,” murmured George,
as a shutter rattled.</p>

<p>“Hark!” ordered Tom again.</p>

<p>There was some sound outside. All the boys
heard it plainly, and a dog they had borrowed
that day from Sam, to help them in tracking any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
game on the trail of which they might get, sat
up and growled.</p>

<p>“Someone is out there,” said Tom in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Some animal&mdash;a skunk, maybe,” suggested
Bert. “I’m going to stay in. I don’t like him&mdash;not
for a scent!” and he laughed at his own joke.</p>

<p>Tom, however, was softly getting up from the
couch. He looked fixedly toward one certain
window.</p>

<p>“Jack, turn the light out suddenly!” he ordered
in a whisper. “Bert, have your gun
ready.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think it is&mdash;anyone?” asked
Bert, as he reached for his gun, which he had
finished cleaning, and put together again.</p>

<p>“Someone or&mdash;something,” went on Tom, and
his voice did not rise above a whisper. He moved
slowly over toward the window.</p>

<p>“Here goes the glim!” Jack announced, and
at once the cabin was darkened. It took but a
minute, however, for the boys’ eyes to become
accustomed to the change, and they saw moonlight
streaming through the window toward which
Tom was moving. The others followed him,
walking softly.</p>

<p>“There he goes&mdash;it <em>is</em> someone!” hoarsely
whispered Bert, and he pointed to a black figure
stealing over the snow. It was plainly in sight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
for the ground was deeply covered with snow.</p>

<p>“It’s a bear!” George burst out. “It’s a
bear! Where’s my gun? Where do you shoot
a bear, anyhow? I don’t want to spoil the skin.
Say, where’s my gun?”</p>

<p>“Dry up!” ordered Tom sharply. “It isn’t
a bear!”</p>

<p>“It is so!” began George. “Where’s
my&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Before anyone could stop him, or object, Bert
had slipped to the door, opened it, and had fired
his gun at the retreating black object.</p>

<p>“Look out!” Tom cried. “You might kill
him! That’s a man&mdash;not a bear, Bert!”</p>

<p>“I know it,” was the calm answer. “I only
fired over his head to scare him. Look at him
scoot, would you?”</p>

<p>And indeed the black object that George had
thought was a bear suddenly straightened up, revealing
itself to be a man. He ran with fast strides
toward the circle of woods that were all about
the hunting cabin. The man reached the shelter
of the black trees a little later, and was soon lost
to sight.</p>

<p>“A man!” gasped George. “It was a man!”</p>

<p>“That’s what it was,” added Bert.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?” demanded
Jack. “Was he sneaking around this
cabin?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s about it,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“But who was he?”</p>

<p>“That’s for us to guess,” went on the young
hunter. “But I fancy I can come pretty near it.”</p>

<p>“You mean Professor Skeel?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Him, or one of his two friends.”</p>

<p>“But what would he, or they, be doing around
our cabin?”</p>

<p>“That,” said Tom, and he spoke more soberly
than he had for some time, “that is something
I’d give a great deal to learn. It’s a mystery
that’s been bothering me for some time.”</p>

<p>The chums looked at their friend in silence for
a moment, and then Jack remarked:</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a peep around outside.”</p>

<p>The others followed, two of them carrying
guns. They made a circuit of the cabin in the
moonlight, but no other uninvited callers were
observed. There were footprints about the shack,
however, which showed that the man, whoever he
was, had been listening under several of the windows.</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t hear any secrets, for we
weren’t talking any,” Tom said with a laugh, as
he and his chums went indoors again.</p>

<p>“Except to say that we were going to Camp
No. 3 to-morrow,” said Bert.</p>

<p>“That’s no secret.”</p>

<p>But it was the very information the man, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
had been eavesdropping under the window, had
come to obtain. He ran off with a smile of satisfaction
on his evil face.</p>

<p>“They’ve got nerve&mdash;firing at me!” he muttered,
not thinking of his own “nerve” in doing
what he had done.</p>

<p>The boys were rather alarmed for a while, and
quite indignant. They decided to take some harsh
measures, if need be, to keep Skeel and his cronies
off the game preserve. And with this resolve they
went to bed, for they wanted to make an early
start the next morning.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock the next day found our four friends
well on their way to Camp No. 3. They had
started their hunt in that general direction. It
was an hour later, when, after several false
alarms, the dog gave tongue to a peculiar cry.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“It’s a bear!” decided Bert. “Sam said the
dog would yelp that way when he struck the trail.
Come on, fellows!”</p>

<p>They ran forward to rejoin their dog, that had
gone on ahead. He was now barking fast and
furiously, and had evidently gotten on the track
of something.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a bear!” decided Tom, when he
had noted the tracks in the snow. “And they’re
fresh, too, otherwise the dog couldn’t smell ’em!
They won’t lie long on snow. Go on, old sport!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and thus encouraged the dog bounded forward.</p>

<p>How the bear came to be out at that time of
the year, the boys did not stop to think. But they
eagerly followed the trail. It led on through the
woods, and they hardly noted their direction.</p>

<p>At noon they stopped for a hasty lunch, grudging
the time it took, for they were anxious to get
sight of the big game. Once more they were on
the trail.</p>

<p>“But it seems to be getting dark suddenly,”
commented Jack. “I wonder if we’d better keep
on?”</p>

<p>“Certainly&mdash;why not?” asked Bert. “The
trail is getting fresher all the while. Come on,
we’ll have him soon. He’s a big one, too!”</p>

<p>Again the boys pressed forward, the dog baying
from time to time.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>LOST IN A STORM</small></h2>


<p>Either the bear was a better traveler than the
boys gave the brute credit for being, or the trail
was not as fresh as Bert had supposed. For
though they went on and on, they did not see
the black ungainly form of Bruin looming up before
them.</p>

<p>They were traveling through a rather thin part
of the forest then, making good time, for the
snow was not so deep here. Occasionally they
thought they had glimpses of the animal they
sought, but it always proved to be nothing but a
shadow, or a movement in the bushes, caused by
the passage of some big rabbit.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” suddenly cried George,
pointing to the left.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s him!” eagerly agreed Jack.</p>

<p>Tom and Bert also agreed that they saw something
more substantial, this time, than a shadow.
But a moment later the black object, for such it
had been, was lost sight of.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Tom, as enthusiastic as any
of his chums. “We’ve got him now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>They raced forward, until they came to the
place where they had seen the black object, and
then they noticed a curious thing. For there
were two sets of marks&mdash;human footprints, and
the broad-toed tracks of the bear.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” cried Jack. “Was that a
man we saw, or the bear?”</p>

<p>No one could say for certain. But this much
was sure. The bear’s tracks led in one direction,
and the man’s in another.</p>

<p>Was the bear chasing the man, or was the man
hunting the bear, was another phase of the question.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said Tom, who had been carefully
examining the two sets of impressions in the
snow. “Here’s how I size this up. The bear’s
tracks go in a straight line, or nearly so, as you
can easily see. But the man’s tracks are in the
form of a letter V and we are at the angle right
here. The angle comes up right close to the trail
of the bear, too.</p>

<p>“Now I think the man was walking through
the woods, approaching the bear. He didn’t
know it until he was almost on the beast and then
the man saw it. Of course he turned away at
once and ran back. You can tell that the footprints
that approach the bear’s trail are made
more slowly than the others&mdash;going away. In the
last case the man was running away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
bear. But the bear wasn’t afraid, and kept
straight on, paying no attention to the man.”</p>

<p>“That’s good argument,” observed Bert.</p>

<p>“Can you tell us who the man was?” demanded
George.</p>

<p>“I’m not detective enough for that,” Tom confessed.
“But I don’t believe the man was a
hunter with a gun.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Jack wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Because if he had a gun, he would have fired
at the bear, and we’d have seen some change in
the bear’s trail. Bruin would either have run at
the shot, or attacked the man, provided the bullet
didn’t kill at once. And you can see for yourselves
that nothing like that happened. So I
argue that the man had no gun.”</p>

<p>“Then he was Skeel, or one of his two partners,”
said George.</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?” asked Bert,
curiously.</p>

<p>“Because we never saw either of them with a
gun.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t prove anything,” Tom said.
“There are lots of men in these woods who
haven’t guns. It might have been Sam Wilson.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell anything by the footprints?”
asked Bert.</p>

<p>“No. The star mark isn’t there, but that’s
nothing. Well, whoever he was he got away, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
we didn’t get close enough to make out who he
was.”</p>

<p>“I tell you where you’re wrong in one thing,
though, Tom,” spoke Jack.</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“You said the man came up to the bear and
ran away, turning off at an angle. I don’t believe
he saw the bear, because we were watching
the man, and we would have seen the bear if he
had seen him, too. For it was right here we lost
sight of the man.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I am wrong about that part of
it,” admitted Tom, “but at least the man didn’t
cross the bear’s trail. Something turned him back
when he saw the marks of the paws in the snow.”</p>

<p>That seemed reasonable enough.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s follow the dog,” suggested Bert.
“He’s after the bear, anyhow.”</p>

<p>This was so, for the dog had not even paused
at the prints of the man’s feet in the snow. He
evidently preferred Bruin for game.</p>

<p>But now it was getting so dark that it was difficult
for the boys to see, even with the whiteness
caused by the covering of snow on the ground.</p>

<p>“I say,” Tom spoke, when they had gone on a
little farther. “I think we’d better turn back. It
will be night before we realize it, and we’re a long
way from either camp. It’s a question in my mind
whether we hadn’t better start back for Camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
No. 2, and let three wait for a day or so. It’s
going to snow too, soon, if I’m any judge.”</p>

<p>“Why, we’re probably as near to No. 3 as we
are to No. 2,” observed Jack. “Why not keep
on? We haven’t been to Camp No. 3 yet, and I
want to see what it’s like.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll leave it to a vote,” decided Tom,
who never tried to “run” things where his chums
were concerned. “One place is as good as another
to me, but we’ve got to do something&mdash;and
that pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“We’d better give up the bear, at least for to-night,”
spoke Bert, and there was regret in his
voice. “But we can take up the trail to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Whistle back the dog,” suggested George.
“And then we’ll decide what to do.”</p>

<p>But the dog did not want to come back. They
could hear him baying in the depths of the now
dark forest, but whether he was in sight of the
bear, or was giving tongue because the trail was
getting fresher, was impossible to say.</p>

<p>At any rate, the dog did not come back in response
to the whistles shrilly emitted in his direction.</p>

<p>“Well, let him go,” said Bert. “He’ll find his
way to one camp or another, I guess, if he doesn’t
go home to Sam. He said the dog often stayed
out in the woods all night, and came back in the
morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right&mdash;let him go,” assented Tom. “And
now what shall we do about ourselves? Here
comes the snow!” he cried a moment later, for
the white flakes began falling in a swirl all about
them.</p>

<p>“In for a blizzard!” commented Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, not as bad as that,” murmured Bert.</p>

<p>“Do they have blizzards up here? How long
do they last? Does it get very cold? How much
snow&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Why!” exclaimed Tom. “We’ve
got something else to do besides answering questions.
Now, fellows, what is it to be&mdash;Camp No.
3 or Camp No. 2? We’ve got to decide.”</p>

<p>“I say No. 3,” called out Bert.</p>

<p>“Same here,” echoed Jack.</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” was the remark of George.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t agree with you, but I’ll give in,”
assented Tom. “The majority rules. But I think
it would be better to go back to No. 2 Camp.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Because we know just where it is, and we
know we can be sure of a warm place, and plenty
to eat.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we at No. 3?” asked George.</p>

<p>“Maybe, and then again, maybe not. We certainly
will have to hunt for it, and it’s only a
chance that it may have wood and food stored
there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sam said it had,” observed Bert.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But there have been men roaming
about these woods that I wouldn’t trust not
to take grub from an unoccupied cabin,” went on
Tom. “However, we’ll take a chance, but I
think it’s a mistake.”</p>

<p>They turned about, and headed in as straight a
line as they could for Camp No. 3. They knew
the general direction, and had some landmarks
to go by.</p>

<p>The storm grew more and more fierce. The
snow was almost as impenetrable as a fog, and
there was a cold, biting wind. It stung the faces
of the boys and made walking difficult. It was
constantly growing darker.</p>

<p>“I say!” called Bert, after a bit. He stopped
floundering about in a drift, and went on: “I
say, does anyone know where we are?”</p>

<p>“On the road to Ramsen,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we are,” Bert resumed. “I
think we’re off the trail&mdash;lost!”</p>

<p>“Lost!” echoed George.</p>

<p>“Yes, lost, and in a blinding snowstorm,” went
on Bert.</p>

<small>THE DESERTED CABIN</small></h2>


<p>Bert’s words struck rather a chill to the hearts
of his chums. Not that they were cowards, for
they were not, and they had faced danger before,
and were used to doing things for themselves.</p>

<p>But now they were in a strange, mountain wilderness,
following an unknown trail, and night
was coming on rapidly. The storm had already
burst, and it was growing worse momentarily.</p>

<p>“Do you really think we are lost?” questioned
Jack, looking about him as well as he could in
the maze of white.</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” responded Bert. “I can’t make
out the least sign of a trail in these woods, and
we have to follow one to get to Camp No. 3, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right,” put in George. “We are
going it blind.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been going according to compass, since
we gave up the hunt for the bear,” commented
Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, it will be more by good luck than good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
management if we find either camp now,” said
Bert. “But come on&mdash;we’ve got to do something.”</p>

<p>“Which way shall we go?” asked George.
“We don’t want to get lost any worse than we
are.”</p>

<p>“We can’t!” spoke Bert, dryly&mdash;that is, as
“dryly” as he could with snow forcing itself into
his mouth. “We’re as lost as we’ll ever be. The
thing now is to start finding ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try this way,” proposed Tom, indicating
the left. “According to my compass Camp No.
3 ought to lie off about there.”</p>

<p>“And how far away?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Not more than four miles&mdash;maybe five. But
we can make that in about an hour and a half, if
we don’t get off the trail.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” commented Bert. “We
can’t see any trail. We are going it absolutely
blind!”</p>

<p>And going it blind they certainly were. They
were all a bit alarmed now, for they had no
shelter for the night, and they had eaten most of
their food.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they tramped along over the snow,
there came a crash in the underbrush to one side.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried George, nervously.</p>

<p>“That bear&mdash;&mdash;” began Bert, slinging around
his gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!” cried Tom. “It’s our dog
come back to us!”</p>

<p>And so it was. The intelligent and lonesome
brute had abandoned the bear’s trail, and had
come back to join his human friends. He was
exhausted from long, hard running.</p>

<p>“Now he’ll lead us to one camp or another,”
said Tom. “Welcome to our city, Towser!”</p>

<p>“What happened to the bear?” asked Jack, as
the dog leaped about caressingly from one to the
other.</p>

<p>“Evidently nothing,” Tom said. “I don’t believe
the dog found him. His name isn’t Towser
though, by the way. I’ve forgotten what Sam did
call him, but it wasn’t Towser.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think he didn’t find the
bear?” Bert wanted to know.</p>

<p>“He’d show some evidence of it if he had,”
was the reply. “He’d have a scratch or two.
No, I think he gave up the chase soon after we
did, and came after us.”</p>

<p>“Well, now he’s here, let’s make some use of
him,” suggested George. “Do you really think
he’ll lead us back to camp, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a chance of it,” Tom affirmed.
“Let’s give him a trial. Here, old boy!” he
called to the dog, a beautiful specimen. “Home,
old fellow!”</p>

<p>The dog barked, wagged his tail, and set off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
on a run through the driving snow. He barked
loudly, turning now and then to see if any of the
four young hunters were following.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” cried Jack. “Come on,
boys. He’ll lead us, all right!”</p>

<p>“But <em>where</em>, is another question,” Tom put in.
“My early education was neglected. I never
learned dog talk, though I can swim that fashion
pretty well.”</p>

<p>“Swimming isn’t going to do any good&mdash;not
in this weather,” murmured Bert, buttoning his
mackinaw tighter about him, and beating his arms
at his sides, for they all had been standing still,
and were rather chilled.</p>

<p>“I could talk hog-Latin,” Jack said with a
smile, “but I don’t believe that is any good for
a dog. Call him back, Tom. You seem to have
more influence over him than anyone else, and he’s
getting too far ahead. I wonder where he’s going,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t much care&mdash;Camp one, two, or three
will suit me just about now,” Tom remarked, as
he turned his face to avoid a stinging blast of
snowflakes. “Surely the dog knows his way to
all three of them, and, if they are too far, he may
lead us to Sam’s farm. That wouldn’t be so
bad.”</p>

<p>“Nothing would be bad where there was a
warm fire and plenty of grub,” commented Bert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
“But call that dog back, Tom, or we’ll lose him
again. He’s off there somewhere, barking to beat
the band!”</p>

<p>Tom whistled shrilly. A series of barks came
in answer, and, a little later the dog himself came
bounding through the snow. His muzzle was all
whitened where he had been burrowing, perhaps
after some luckless rabbit. But his bright eyes
were glowing as the boys could see in the half-darkness
that had fallen, and Towser, as they
continued to call him, for want of a better name,
seemed delighted at something or another.
Whether it was the storm, the fun he had had
trailing the bear, or whether he was just glad to
be with the boys, and happy over the prospect of
adventures to come, no one could say.</p>

<p>The dog barked, wagged his tail, ran on a little
way, came back, barked some more, ran on again,
and then repeated the performance over and over,
getting more and more excited all the while.</p>

<p>“He wants us to follow him,” decided Tom.
“All right, old man, I’m with you,” he said.
“Come on, boys. We’ll see what comes of it.”</p>

<p>Together the four hunters set off with the dog
in the lead. Truth to tell they did not feel very
much like hunters that day, nor had they had any
luck. Matters seemed to be going against them.
And in the storm and darkness there was a distinct
feeling of depression over everyone. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
dog was really the only cheerful creature there,
and he had spirits enough for all of them, could
they but be transferred.</p>

<p>“Whew! This <em>is</em> a storm!” cried Tom, as
he bent his head to the blast.</p>

<p>It did seem to be getting worse. The wind had
a keener cut and whirled the sharp flakes of snow
into one’s face with stinging force.</p>

<p>“It’s a young blizzard,” affirmed Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, if it does this in its youthful days, what
will happen when it grows up?” Bert wanted to
know, as he paused and turned around to get the
wind out of his face while he caught his breath.
No one took the trouble to answer him.</p>

<p>The dog seemed impatient at the slow progress
of the lads, for he was now well ahead of them.
They could only tell where he was by his barks,
and by an occasional flurry of snow as he burrowed
in some drift and then scrambled out
again.</p>

<p>“Better call him back again, Tom,” suggested
George. “He’ll get away beyond us, and soon it
will be so dark we can’t see our hands before
our faces.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I will,” Tom assented. “I’d put
a leash on him if I had a bit of cord, and hold
him back.”</p>

<p>“Here’s some,” Jack said, offering a piece. “I
had it tied around the package of sandwiches.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“By the way&mdash;any of those same sandwiches
left?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“A few&mdash;why?”</p>

<p>“Because that may be all we’ll get to eat to-night.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Bert. “Aren’t we going
toward camp?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I can’t say,” was Tom’s answer,
as he whistled for the dog. “We may, and then,
again, we may not.”</p>

<p>“But where are we heading, then?” George
wanted to know, as Tom proceeded to tie the
cord on Towser’s collar.</p>

<p>“That’s more than I can say,” Tom made answer.
“We’re in the hands of fate, as they say
in books.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d rather hang to Towser’s tail,” spoke
Jack, with grim humor.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I got you fellows into this mess,”
went on Tom, as they advanced again through
the storm and darkness, this time keeping the dog
closer to them by means of the cord.</p>

<p>“What mess?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Getting lost, and all that.”</p>

<p>“Forget it!” advised Jack. “It wasn’t your
fault at all. You wanted to go back to No. 2
Camp, and the rest of us favored this move. I
wish, now, we had taken your advice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, mine was only a guess,” Tom said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
“We might have been as badly off had we gone
the other way. We’ll just have to trust to luck.
Come on. But what I meant was that coming out
to-day to hunt was my proposition. I was afraid
there was a storm coming.”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t have stayed home on that account,”
George asserted. “We’re all in the same
boat together, and we’ll have to sink or swim&mdash;or
skate,” he added, as the icy wind smote him.</p>

<p>It was now about six o’clock, but as dark as it
would have been at midnight. The moon was
hidden behind dark clouds, but of course the white
snow made it lighter than otherwise would have
been the case. But in the dense woods even this
did not add much to the comfort of our friends,
and its increasing depth made it harder to walk.</p>

<p>Almost before the boys knew it, they had
emerged from the forest to a road. They could
tell that at once.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” cried Tom. “Now we’ll be all
right. A good road to follow.”</p>

<p>“And a signpost, too, to tell us which way to
go!” added Jack.</p>

<p>He pointed through the storm to where was evidently
a crossroad, at the intersection of which
was a post with the familiar boards on it.</p>

<p>“What does it say?” asked Bert, as Tom stood
at the foot of it.</p>

<p>“Have to get out the electric light,” Tom said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
producing a pocket flashlight. By its powerful
tungsten gleam, he read:</p>

<p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Seven Miles to Ramsen</span>
</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket!” he cried. “Ramsen is
the way we want to go. Camp No. 3 lies in that
direction. Now we’re all right, boys!”</p>

<p>“Good old signpost!” murmured Jack.</p>

<p>But, had he only known it, the signpost was a
“bad” one, though, as we know, that was not the
fault of the post itself.</p>

<p>Trudging along the road was easier now, and
the boys made better time. But it was tiresome
work at that. And when, a little later, they saw
a building looming up at one side of the road,
Bert cried:</p>

<p>“There’s our camp now!”</p>

<p>For a moment they thought it was, but a closer
look showed that it was not. It was an old deserted
hut, almost in ruins, and as Tom flashed
his light within, a sorry sight was presented to the
eyes of the boys.</p>

<p>“Let’s go inside,” was Tom’s proposal, and
his chums looked at him in some amazement.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>SPIED UPON</small></h2>


<p>“What do we want to go in there for?” asked
Jack, at length.</p>

<p>“Because,” was the rather short answer of
Tom. Then, feeling perhaps that he might explain
a little more at length, he turned from
where he stood in the tumbled-down doorway,
and added:</p>

<p>“Let’s get in out of the storm. This is a good
place to rest, away from that cutting wind. Quiet,
Towser,” he added, for the dog showed signs of
not wanting to go in. He growled and hung back.
Then he looked in the direction in which they had
come, and his hair rose on the back of his neck
as though he saw something the boys did not see,
and resented the sight&mdash;whatever it was.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that,” commented Bert. “Dogs
know more than we do&mdash;sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on in!” repeated Tom, and he
spoke to the dog again. This time Towser followed
his temporary master inside the hut.</p>

<p>“But what gets me is <em>why</em> are we going in?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
objected George. “It will only delay us, and if
we’ve got to make seven miles to Ramsen to-night,
we’d better be getting at it.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” spoke Tom quickly. “I think
we can’t get at it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” came from Jack.</p>

<p>“I mean that we can’t go on in this storm. It’s
getting worse every minute, and we may stray off
the road. We have found this shelter providentially,
and we ought to take advantage of it. It
will give us a half-decent place to stay, and we
won’t be buried in the snow which may happen if
we keep on.</p>

<p>“Come inside and stay here, that’s what I
mean,” Tom went on. “It might be a heap-sight
worse,” and he flashed his torch about the bare
and crumbling ruin of the cabin.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Bert. “Do you mean to stay
here all night?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Tom. “It’s better than
being out in the storm, isn’t it? Hark to that
wind!”</p>

<p>As he spoke a blast howled around the corner
of the shack, and blew a cloud of flakes in through
a glassless window.</p>

<p>“It’s a little better than outside&mdash;but not
much,” murmured George. “Look at those windows.”</p>

<p>“We can find something to stuff in them,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Tom cheerfully. “There may be some old bags
about. And we haven’t been upstairs yet. This
place may be furnished better than we think.
Come on, boys, make up your minds to stay here.”</p>

<p>“Well, we might do worse, that’s a fact,”
slowly admitted Jack. “Say, look at that dog,
would you!”</p>

<p>His manner, as he said this, was excited, but no
less so than that of the dog. The animal brushed
past the group of boys, fairly pulling loose the
improvised leash from Tom’s hand and stood in
the doorway with bristling hair, lips drawn back
from his teeth and showing every appearance of
anger.</p>

<p>“Something ails him,” spoke George, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“I should say so,” agreed Tom, rubbing his
hand where the stout cord had cut into him, even
in spite of his heavy mitten.</p>

<p>“It’s that bear!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“What?” questioned Tom.</p>

<p>“That bear we were following,” explained
Jack. “It’s outside now, and the dog has winded
him. Where’s my gun? I’m going to have a potshot
at him!”</p>

<p>He started toward the corner where he had
stood up his gun. The interior of the cabin was
fairly light, for Tom had snapped on the permanent
switch of his little pocket electric light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on a minute!” Tom said, placing a
hand on his chum’s shoulder. “What are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>“Don’t go out,” advised Tom. “I don’t believe
it’s the bear, to begin with, and, in the second
place, if it <em>is</em>, you wouldn’t stand any chance of
hitting him in this storm. And you might get lost.
It’s a regular blizzard outside.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think it isn’t the bear?”
asked Jack, ignoring Tom’s other reasons.</p>

<p>“Well, from the way the dog acts, for one
thing,” was the answer. “He didn’t act that way
before, when we had a plain sight of the trail,
and Towser may even have come close to Bruin
himself.”</p>

<p>“If it isn’t the bear&mdash;who is it&mdash;or&mdash;what is
it?” demanded George.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was Tom’s frank reply.</p>

<p>“Let’s give a yell,” suggested Bert. “Maybe
it’s Sam Wilson, or someone who could put us on
the right road. I don’t fancy staying here all
night if it can be helped. Let’s give a yell.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Tom agreed. “Here, Towser,”
he went on to the dog, “come in here and behave
yourself.”</p>

<p>But the animal did not seem so disposed. He
remained in the doorway, looking out into the
storm, now and then growling hoarsely in his
throat, but showing no disposition to dash out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Certainly he was acting very strangely, but
whether it was fear or anger the boys could not
decide.</p>

<p>“Well, whoever it is, or whatever, we’ve got
plenty of guns and ammunition,” remarked
George. “We haven’t had a decent shot to-day.”</p>

<p>Which was very true. They had had great
hopes, but that was all.</p>

<p>“Come on if we’re going to yell,” suggested
Jack. “And if we don’t raise someone, we’ll
prepare to stay here. It’s the best we can do,
fellows.”</p>

<p>They united their voices in a shout, and the
dog added to the din by barking. He seemed to
feel better when the lads were making as much
noise as they could.</p>

<p>But the echoes of the boys’ voices, blown back
to them by the snow-laden wind, was all the answer
they received. They waited, and called
again, but no one replied to them. Nor, as at
least George half-expected, did they hear the
growls of a bear. The wind howled, the snow
rattled on the sides and roof of the cabin, for
the flakes were almost as hard as sleet. But that
was all.</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to put up at this ‘hotel,’”
said Bert, after a pause. The dog had quieted
down now, as though whatever had aroused him
had passed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s take a look around and see what we’ve
drawn,” suggested Jack. “If there’s any wood,
we can make a fire, and there must be some of
that grub left.”</p>

<p>“There is,” announced Bert, who had constituted
himself a sort of commissary department.
“We’ve got some sandwiches, and I can make
coffee.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t so bad,” remarked Tom. “Once
we have a little feed, we’ll all feel better. And
in the morning the storm may have stopped, so
we can easily find our road. We’re on the right
one, I’m sure, for that signboard said seven miles
to Ramsen, and that’s in the direction of Camp
No. 3.”</p>

<p>If Tom had only known about that changed
signboard!</p>

<p>Each of the lads carried a powerful electric
light, with a tungsten bulb. It was operated by
a small, dry battery. It was intended only for a
flashing light, of a second or so each time, but
there was a switch arrangement so that the light
could be held steady and permanent, though of
course this used up the battery quickly.</p>

<p>“I’ll let my light burn,” proposed Tom. “It’s
nearly burned out anyhow, and you fellows can
save yours until later.”</p>

<p>“If we could have a fire, we wouldn’t need a
light,” Bert said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Tom. “Let’s look
about a bit.”</p>

<p>There was a hearth in the main room of the deserted
cabin, and on it were the ashes of a fire,
long since dead and cold. But it seemed to show
that the chimney would draw. Scattered about
the room were pieces of old boxes and barrel
staves, and a pile of these was soon set ablaze
on the hearth.</p>

<p>“That looks better!” remarked Bert, with
satisfaction, as he rubbed his hands in front of
the blaze. “Now if we had a way of stopping
up some of these broken windows, we wouldn’t
be so cold.”</p>

<p>“Take some of those bags,” suggested Tom,
indicating a pile in a corner. It looked like the
bed of some chance tramp who had accepted the
shelter the deserted shack offered.</p>

<p>The boys soon had the broken lights filled in,
and when the tumble-down door had been propped
up in the entrance, the cabin was not such a bad
shelter, with a blazing fire going.</p>

<p>“Now for a look upstairs,” suggested Tom,
for the cabin was of two stories, though the top
one was very low.</p>

<p>“I’d rather eat,” suggested George.</p>

<p>“It won’t take long to investigate,” Tom said.</p>

<p>They went up the rickety stairs, but the trip
hardly paid for their pains, for there was less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
upstairs than there was down. Some few rags,
bits of broken bottles, boxes and barrels were
seen, and that was all.</p>

<p>“And now for grub!” cried George, when they
were once more in the main room downstairs.
“Let’s get that coffee going, and eat what there
is.”</p>

<p>The boys carried a coffee-pot with them, and a
supply of the ground berries. Some snow was
scooped up in the pot, which was set on the coals
to provide the necessary water by melting the
white crystals. Then the packages of sandwiches,
rather depleted, it is true, were set out. A little
later the aroma of the boiling beverage filled the
room.</p>

<p>“That smells fine!” murmured Jack.</p>

<p>“It surely does,” agreed Bert. “Now for a
feed.”</p>

<p>They all felt better after they had eaten what
food was left from lunch. And surely they needed
the grateful and stimulating warmth of the
coffee, even though it was rather muddy, and was
drunk out of tin cups they carried with them.
They even had condensed milk and sugar, for
these were carried in a case, in which fitted the
pot and the ground coffee. This was one of Tom’s
up-to-date discoveries.</p>

<p>To Towser were tossed the odds and ends of
the sandwiches, and he ate them greedily, drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
some snow water which George melted for
him in a tin he found in one corner of the cabin.</p>

<p>Then the boys prepared to spend the night in
the deserted cabin. They sat about the fire, on
improvised seats made from broken boxes, and
watched the fire, which certainly was cheerful.
They expected to only doze through the night,
and hoped to get on the proper road by morning.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dog, which had been peacefully
lying in front of the hearth, sprang up with a
growl and bark. He startled the boys.</p>

<p>“Quiet!” commanded Tom, but the animal
continued to growl.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“What is?” asked Tom. “Just because he
barks on account of hearing something, or scenting
something, that’s beyond us?”</p>

<p>“No, not that so much, but it’s a funny feeling
I have,” said Jack. “I feel just as if we were
being spied upon.”</p>

<p>“Spied upon!” repeated Tom. “Say, you’re
as nervous as a girl, old man!”</p>

<p>Before Jack could reply, the dog had leaped up
and rushed out into the storm through a small
opening where the old door was only propped
against the frame.</p>

<small>LOST AGAIN</small></h2>


<p>“Now what’s up?” cried Tom, as he made a
rush after the dog. But he was too late. Towser
was out in the snow.</p>

<p>“It’s that bear again,” George said.</p>

<p>“You’ve got bear on the brain,” commented
Bert.</p>

<p>The boys looked out and listened, but they
could neither see nor hear anything, and soon the
dog came back. But, even as he reached the door,
he turned and sent a challenging bark toward
someone&mdash;or something.</p>

<p>“This sure is queer,” murmured Bert.</p>

<p>“And it’s queer what Jack said,” went on Tom.
“About being spied upon. What do you mean,
old man?”</p>

<p>“Just what I said,” was the answer. “Just
before the dog gave the alarm, I had a feeling
as though someone outside was keeping watch
over this shack.”</p>

<p>“That sure is a funny feeling,” commented
George. “Who would it be? There aren’t any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
persons up around here except Sam Wilson, or
maybe some of those Indian guides he knows.”</p>

<p>“It might be one of the Indians,” suggested
Bert. “They might be sneaking around, to see
what they could pick up.”</p>

<p>“A wild animal wouldn’t make a fellow feel
as I felt,” decided Jack. “But maybe I’m only
fussy, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are&mdash;worse than a girl,” said Tom, with
a laugh that took the sharpness out of the words.
“I guess it’s only the storm, and the effect of
being in a strange place. Now let’s settle down
and take it easy. There’s no one outside.”</p>

<p>Once more they disposed themselves before the
cheerful blaze, the dog stretching out at full
length to dry his shaggy coat that was wet with
melting snow.</p>

<p>“I wonder what sort of a place this was?”
spoke Jack, at length.</p>

<p>“Must have been a hunter’s cabin,” suggested
Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s too big for that. This looks as though
people had lived in it once,” declared Bert. “Besides,
it’s too near the road for a hunter to want
to use it. I guess the family died off, or moved
away, and there isn’t enough population up here
to make it so crowded that they have to use this
shack.”</p>

<p>“Well, it comes in handy for us,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
George. “I could go another sandwich, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“All the going you’ll do will be to go without,”
laughed Bert, grimly. “There isn’t a crumb left,
but I could manage to squeeze out some more
coffee.”</p>

<p>“Better save it for morning,” advised Tom.
“We’ll need it worse by then.”</p>

<p>The storm still raged, but inside the deserted
cabin the boys were fairly comfortable. They
had on thick, warm garments, and these, with
the glowing fire, made them feel little of the nipping
cold that prevailed with the blizzard.</p>

<p>The wind howled down the chimney, scattering
the light ashes now and then, and filling the room
with the pungent odor of smoke. Around some
of the windows, where the rags were stuffed in
the broken panes, little piles of sifted snow gathered.</p>

<p>At times the whole frail structure shook with
the force of the blast, and at such times the boys
would look at each other with a trace of fear on
their faces. For the ramshackle structure might
fall down on them.</p>

<p>But as it did not, after each recurrent windy
outburst, they felt more confident. Perhaps the
cabin was built stronger than they thought. The
dog showed no uneasiness at these manifestations
of Nature. He did not even open his eyes when
the wind howled its loudest and blew its strongest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
And, too, he seemed to have gotten over the
strange fear that caused him to act so oddly.</p>

<p>The other boys had rather laughed at Jack’s
“notion” of being “spied upon,” but had they
been able to see through the white veil of snow
that was falling all about the cabin, they would
have realized that there is sometimes something
like telepathy, or second sight. For, in reality,
the boys were being observed by a pair of evil
eyes.</p>

<p>And the evil eyes were set in an evil face, which,
in turn belonged to the body of a man who had
constructed for himself a rude shelter against the
storm.</p>

<p>It was such a shelter as would be hastily built
by a hunter caught in the open for the night&mdash;a
sort of “lean-to,” with the open side away from
the direction in which the wind blew. But it could
not have been made in this storm, and, consequently,
must have been put up before the blizzard
began.</p>

<p>The lean-to showed signs of a practiced hand,
for it was fairly comfortable, and the man in it
chuckled to himself now and then as he looked
over toward the deserted cabin.</p>

<p>The man was on the watch, and he had prepared
for just this emergency. At times, when
he heard the barking of the dog, a frown could
have been seen on his face, had there been a light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
by which to observe it. But the lean-to was in
absolute darkness, save what light was reflected
by the white snow.</p>

<p>“I thought they’d end up here,” was the man’s
muttered remark to himself, for he was all alone.
“Yes, I thought they would. It’s the nearest
shelter after they left the doctored signboard.
Naturally they turned in here. That changed sign
did the trick all right. Lucky I thought of it.
Now I wonder what the next move will be?”</p>

<p>He did not answer himself for a few seconds,
but crouched down, looking in the direction of the
cabin, through the chinks of which shone the light
of the fire.</p>

<p>“They’ll stay there until morning, I reckon,”
communed the man to himself. “Then they’ll
light out and try to find Ramsen. But they won’t
locate it by going the way that sign pointed,” and
he chuckled. “They’ll only get deeper in the
woods, and then, if we can cut out that Fairfield
from among the others, we’ll have him where we
want him. If we can’t, we’ll manage to take him
anyhow.”</p>

<p>He paused, as though to go over in his mind
the details of the evil scheme he was plotting, and
resumed:</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ll light out in the morning. I’ll have
to follow ’em until I make sure which trail they
take. Then the rest will be easy. It isn’t going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to be any fun to stay here all night, but it will
be worth the money, I guess.</p>

<p>“That is, if Skeel ponies up as he says he will.
And if Skeel tries to cut up any funny tricks, and
cheat me and Whalen, he’ll wish he never had.
He’ll never try it twice!”</p>

<p>With another look out at the dimly lighted
cabin, as if to make sure that none of those he
was spying on had left, the man composed himself
to pass the night in his somewhat uncomfortable
shelter. He curled up in a big blanket and went
to sleep. For he was a woodsman born and bred,
and he thought nothing of staying out in the open,
with only a little shelter, through a long, cold
night. He was even comfortable, after his own
fashion.</p>

<p>And slowly the night passed for our four
friends in the deserted cabin.</p>

<p>They had managed to construct a rude sort of
bed by placing old inside doors on some boxes.
Their heavy mackinaws were covers, and the
nearness of the fire on the hearth kept them warm.
Occasionally, through the night, as one or another
awoke from a doze, he would toss on more wood,
to keep the blaze from going out.</p>

<p>The dog whined uneasily once or twice during
the night, but he did not bark or growl. Perhaps
he knew that the man in the lean-to was asleep
also, and would not walk abroad to plot harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s still snowing,” remarked Tom, as
he arose and stretched his cramped muscles.</p>

<p>“How do you know? Is it morning?” asked
George, yawning.</p>

<p>“It’s an imitation of it,” Tom announced. “I
looked out. It’s still snowing to beat the band.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for our cozy camp&mdash;any one of them!”
sighed Jack. “Let’s have what’s left of that coffee,
Bert, and then we’ll hike out and see what we
can find.”</p>

<p>The coffee was rather weak, but it was hot, and
that meant a great deal to the boys who had to
venture out in the cold. Every drop was disposed
of, and then, looking well to their guns,
for though they hardly admitted it to each other,
they had faint hopes of game, the boys set out.</p>

<p>As they emerged from the cabin, they were not
aware of a pair of sharp, ferret-like eyes watching
them from the hidden shelter of the lean-to.
As the wind was blowing toward that shack, and
not away from it, the dog was not this time apprised
by scent of the closeness of an enemy, whatever
had happened the night before.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s start,” proposed Tom. “This is
the road to Ramsen,” and he pointed to the almost
snow-obliterated highway that ran in front
of the deserted cabin they were leaving.</p>

<p>Their hearts were lighter with the coming of
the new day, though their stomachs were almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
empty. But they hoped soon to be at one of
their camping cabins, where, they knew, a good
supply of food awaited them.</p>

<p>On they tramped through the snow. It was
very deep, and the fall seemed to have increased
in rapidity, rather than to have diminished. It
had snowed all night, and was still keeping up
with unabated vigor. In some places there were
deep drifts across the road.</p>

<p>“This sure is heavy going,” observed Jack, as
he plunged tiresomely along.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bert.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how Towser keeps it up,” spoke
George, for the dog was having hard work to
get through the drifts.</p>

<p>“He seems to enjoy it,” commented Tom.
“But it is deep. I think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He did not complete the sentence, for, at that
moment, he stepped into some unseen hole and
went down in a snow pile to his waist.</p>

<p>“Have a hand!” invited Jack, extending a
helping arm to his chum, to pull him up. “What
were you trying to do, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Tom, looking at the
hole into which he had fallen. “But I think we’re
off the road, fellows.”</p>

<p>“I do, too,” came from Bert. “It seems as
though we were going over a field. Yes,” he
went on, “there’s a stump sticking up out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
snow. We’re in some sort of a clearing. We’re
clean off the road!”</p>

<p>It took only a moment for the others to be also
convinced of this.</p>

<p>“We’d better go back,” George said. “We’ve
probably come the wrong way. I don’t believe
this is the road to Ramsen at all.”</p>

<p>“The signboard said it was,” Bert reminded
him.</p>

<p>“I can’t help that. I believe we’re wrong
again&mdash;lost!”</p>

<p>“Lost&mdash;again!” echoed Jack. “Lost in this
wilderness!”</p>

<p>“It does begin to look so,” admitted Tom
slowly. “Where’s that dog?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>THE CAPTURE</small></h2>


<p>Towser had run off again, on one of his attempts
to wiggle through a drift. A shrill whistle
from Tom brought him back again, however,
sneezing because some snow had gotten up his
nose and into his mouth.</p>

<p>“Towser, you old rascal!” Tom exclaimed.
“Why don’t you lead us back to camp?”</p>

<p>“Or to Sam Wilson’s,” added Bert. “That
would be good enough on a pinch, until we get
straightened out. Home, old fellow! Wilson’s
farm! Lead the way!”</p>

<p>The dog barked and leaped about, but he did
not show any inclination to take any particular
direction through the snow-covered wilderness.
He seemed to want to follow, rather than lead.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he knows where Sam Wilson’s
place is,” was Tom’s opinion, after watching the
animal for a while.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s as badly lost as we are,” said
Bert.</p>

<p>For a few seconds the boys stood there rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
at a loss what to do. They had done their best,
but they did not seem to be on the way to success.
The storm was worse than when it first started.
It still snowed hard, and the wind, while not as
strong as it had been during the night, was still
cold and cutting.</p>

<p>The boys turned their backs to it as they stood
there huddled together, hardly knowing what to
do next. Towser, finding he was not wanted immediately,
to trail a bear or some other game,
devoted his energies to burrowing in a snowbank.</p>

<p>“Well, I would like to know where we are,”
said Tom at length.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be a good idea to go back to
the deserted cabin?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“It might not be so bad, if we knew where it
was,” agreed Tom.</p>

<p>“We could at least take that for a starting
point, and try to head for Camp No. 2,” Jack
went on. “I’d be satisfied with that, as long as
we can’t locate No. 3.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I side with you there, all right, old man,”
Tom said, “but <em>where</em> does the old cabin lie?”</p>

<p>“Off there!” said Bert, pointing to the right.</p>

<p>“No, it’s over there,” was the opinion of
George, and he indicated the left.</p>

<p>“It’s right behind you,” insisted Jack.</p>

<p>“And I should say it was in front of us,” spoke
Tom. “So you see we each have a different opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and, as long as we can’t agree, what are we
going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Jack. “But we can’t
stay here doing nothing. We’ve got to get
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Somewhere is very indefinite,” was the remark
George made. “It’s very easy to say it, but hard
to find it. If we could only get back on the road,
we could head in either direction, and some time
or other we would get somewhere. But now we
are in the woods and we may be heading right
toward the middle of the forest instead of toward
the edge. And these forests are no little
picnic groves, either.”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” Tom exclaimed. “But
where is the road? That’s the question.”</p>

<p>It was a question no one could answer, and
they did not try. Eagerly and anxiously they
scanned the expanse of snow for some indication
that a road existed&mdash;even a rough, lumberman’s
highway.</p>

<p>But all they could see, here and there, were
little mounds of snow that indicated where stumps
existed under the white covering. They were in
a clearing, with woods all around them. If they
advanced, they might be going toward the deeper
forest instead of toward the place where civilization,
in the shape of man, had begun to cut down
the trees to make a town or village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we sure have got to do something,”
Tom said, and it was not the first time, either.
“We’ll try each direction, fellows, and see where
we come out. We may have to go the limit, and
tramp a bit in each of four directions, and, again,
it may be our luck to do it the first shot. But
let’s get into action. It’s cold standing still.”</p>

<p>They had given up all hope of game now. Indeed,
the snow was falling so thickly that they
could not have seen a deer or bear until they
were very close to it&mdash;too close it would be, in
the case of the bear.</p>

<p>As for smaller game&mdash;rabbits, squirrels and
partridges, none of those were to be seen. The
snow had driven the smaller animals and the
birds to cover.</p>

<p>“Bur-r-r-r-r! But this is no fun, on an empty
stomach,” grumbled George, as he followed the
others. The dog, having seen his friends start
off, was following them. He seemed to have no
sense of responsibility that he was expected to
lead his friends in the right direction. “I sure
am hungry!” George went on.</p>

<p>“Quit talking about it,” urged Tom. “That
doesn’t do any good, and it makes all of us feel
badly. Have a snow sandwich!”</p>

<p>“It makes you too thirsty,” interposed Jack.
“If you want to drink, we’ll stop, make a fire
of some fir branches, and melt snow in our tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
coffee cups. If you start chewing flakes, you’ll
get a sore mouth, and other things will happen
to you. That’s what a fellow wrote in a book on
Arctic travel.”</p>

<p>“If only we hadn’t eaten all the grub!”
sighed Bert.</p>

<p>“Too late to think of that now,” Tom spoke.
“Come on&mdash;let’s hike!”</p>

<p>Off they started. They decided to make an
effort in each of the four cardinal points, first
selecting that which one of the boys declared led
back to Camp No. 2.</p>

<p>“If we go on for a mile or two, and find
we’re wrong again, back we come and try the
other side,” Tom explained. “But I can’t see
why that sign says seven miles to Ramsen, when
the road is so easy to lose yourself on.”</p>

<p>“It will take us the rest of the day to do that
experimenting,” grumbled George.</p>

<p>“Well, suggest a better plan,” spoke Tom,
quickly. “We’re lost, and if we don’t find the
proper road soon, we’ll be more than all day in
this pickle.”</p>

<p>George had no more to say.</p>

<p>The boys were now a little alarmed at their
plight, for they were cold and hungry, and that
is no condition in which to fight the wintry blast.
But there was nothing they could do except keep
moving. In a way, that was their only hope, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the exercise kept them warm, though it made
them all the more hungry.</p>

<p>“Keep a lookout for game&mdash;even small kinds,”
advised Tom, as they went on. “A rabbit or a
squirrel wouldn’t come amiss now. We could
manage to broil it over the coals of a fire, though
it probably won’t be very nice looking.”</p>

<p>“Who cares for looks when you’re hungry?”
demanded Bert.</p>

<p>But game did not show itself as the boys
tramped on through the snow. They went on for
some distance in the direction first decided on,
but could see no familiar landmarks. Nor did
they reach anything that looked like a road.</p>

<p>“Better go back,” Tom decided, and they did
manage to find the little clearing again.</p>

<p>“Say!” cried Bert, as they stood irresolute as
to which of the three remaining directions to select
next, “aren’t we silly, though?”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Why, because all we had to do was to follow
our trail back in the snow. That would have led
us to the old cabin.”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Our footprints are blown or drifted over
three minutes after we make them, in this wind
and shifting snow,” Tom said. “Look!”</p>

<p>He pointed over the route they had just come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Their earlier footprints were altogether gone.
The expanse of snow was white and unbroken.</p>

<p>“Well, we go this way next,” said Jack. “I
remember because I saw that broken white birch
tree. Head straight for that.”</p>

<p>They did so, but again were doomed to disappointment.
That way led to a low, swampy
place, though there was no water in it at present,
it having been frozen and covered with snow.</p>

<p>“No road here,” Tom said. “Let’s try some
other route.”</p>

<p>“Say!” cried Jack. “What’s the sense of all
four of us going in the same direction all the
while? Why not try four ways at once? The
one who finds the road can fire two shots in quick
succession. The rest of us will then come to
where we hear the shots.”</p>

<p>“A good idea!” commented Tom. “We’ll
try it. Scatter now, and don’t go too far. Oh,
you’re coming with me, are you, Towser?” for
the dog followed him, evidently considering Tom
his master.</p>

<p>The four boys now set off in different directions,
and soon were lost to sight of one another
in the storm. Tom was sure he was going the
route that would take him to the road. He
pressed on eagerly.</p>

<p>The dog ran on ahead, and disappeared.</p>

<p>“He’s fond of taking a lot of exercise,” was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Tom’s mental comment. Then he saw some
bushes, just ahead of him, being agitated and he
went on: “No, he’s coming back. Maybe he’s
found something.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the bushes back of Tom parted with
a crackling of the dry twigs. The lad thought
perhaps it was some animal stirred up by the
dog, and he was advancing his gun, to be in readiness,
when he felt, all at once, something cover
his head. He was in blackness, but he could tell by
the smell that a bag had been thrust over his eyes.</p>

<p>“Here. Quit that! Stop!” yelled Tom, and
then his voice ended in a smothered groan.
Something like a gag had been thrust between
his lips and he was thrown heavily.</p>

<p>For a moment Tom’s senses seemed to leave
him. He could see nothing, but he felt that he
was being mauled. He had a momentary fear
that it might be a bear. But, he reflected, bears
do not throw sacks over one’s head, nor gag one.
It must be men&mdash;but what men?</p>

<p>Vainly Tom struggled. He felt his hands being
tied&mdash;his feet entangled in ropes. He fought, but
was overpowered. Then he heard a voice saying:</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve captured him, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed another voice, and Tom vainly
wondered where he had heard it before. “Yes,
we have him, and now the question is, what to
do with him.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>A PRISONER</small></h2>


<p>Tom was in sort of a daze for the first few
moments following the unexpected and violent
attack on him, an attack culminating in his being
bound so that he could hardly move.</p>

<p>Dimly, and almost uncomprehendingly, he
heard voices murmuring about him&mdash;he could
hear the voices of men above the howl of the
gale that seemed to continue with unabated fury.</p>

<p>Gradually Tom’s senses cleared. The haze
that seemed to envelope his mind passed away
and he began to realize that he must not submit
dumbly to this indignity. He first strained lightly
at his bonds, as if to test them. The sack was
still over his head, so he could not see, and there
was a horribly stuffy and suffocating feeling about
it.</p>

<p>Tom’s effort to loosen his bonds, slight as it
was, had the effect of starting his blood up in a
better circulation, and this helped him to think
better and more quickly.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get out of this!” he told himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
energetically. “This won’t do at all! I wonder
who the scoundrels are who have caught me
this way?”</p>

<p>But Tom did not stop then to argue out that
question. He wanted to devote all his time to
getting himself loose. With that in view, he put
forth all his strength. He was lying on his back,
in a bank of snow, he judged, and he now strained
his arms and legs with all his might.</p>

<p>But he might just as well have saved his
strength. Those who had tied the bonds about
him knew their evil business well, and poor Tom
was like a roped steer. Not only was he unable
to loosen the bonds on his arms and legs, but he
found the effort hurt him, and made him almost
suffocate, because of the gag and the closeness
of the bag over his head.</p>

<p>Then he heard voices speaking again.</p>

<p>“He’s coming to,” said someone&mdash;a vaguely
familiar voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’ll have to come a great deal
harder than that to get away,” was the answer,
and someone chuckled. Tom wished he could
hit that person, whoever he was. His gun had
either fallen or been knocked from his hand at
the first attack.</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do with him?”
asked the voice that had first spoken.</p>

<p>“Wait until&mdash;&mdash;” but the rest of the sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Tom did not hear, for the wind set up a louder
howling at that point, and the words were borne
away with it. Then, too, Tom was at a disadvantage
because of the bag over his ears.</p>

<p>He felt himself being lifted up, and placed in
a more comfortable position, and he was glad of
that, for he felt weak and sick. It must be remembered
that aside from a little coffee that
morning, he had had no breakfast, and that he
had had little or no sleep the night before. With
a scant supper, a battle with the storm, the anxiety
about being lost, and having led his friends,
unconsciously enough, into a scrape, it was no
great wonder that Tom was not altogether himself.</p>

<p>“But who in the world has captured me, and
what do they want of me?” Tom asked himself.
He had an idea it might, perhaps, be some
of the half-breed Indians who had caught him
for the sake of his gun and clothing. Or perhaps
some trapper or guide was guilty.</p>

<p>But if they were after his gun, or what money
he carried, or even the fine mackinaw he wore,
why did they not take those things and make off
into the woods? That would at least leave Tom
free.</p>

<p>But the men remained on guard over the bound
figure of the boy, now sitting upright on a bank
of snow. Tom could dimly hear them moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
about. They were evidently waiting for someone.</p>

<p>“But if they wait long enough, the fellows may
come to look after me,” Tom reasoned. “Jack,
George, and Bert will know how to deal with
these scoundrels.”</p>

<p>Then he reflected that the other lads would not
know where he was unless he fired his gun, and
he could not do that. If one of the others&mdash;Bert,
Jack or George&mdash;found the road, they
would not know where Tom was.</p>

<p>“Unless the dog could lead me to them, or
them to me,” he mused. “I wonder where Towser
is, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Tom’s last view of the animal had been when
it darted into a bush, after some rabbit, perhaps.
Then had come the sudden attack. If the dog
had returned, Tom did not know of it. He only
hoped the animal would “raise some sort of
row,” as he put it.</p>

<p>But there was no evidence of Towser. Tom
could hear only the now low-voiced talk of two
men, and the rush of the wind. That it was
still snowing he was quite sure, and he wondered
what his companions were doing.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware of some new element
that entered into his predicament. One of
the men exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Here he comes now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s good!” responded the other, and
there seemed to be relief in his tones.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see anything of him,” called the newcomer.
“I saw the others&mdash;they’ve separated,
all right, but Fairfield&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’s here! We’ve got him!” was the triumphant
rejoinder of one of the men near Tom.
“Got him good and proper!”</p>

<p>“You have! That’s the ticket. Now we’ll see
what the old man has to say. I guess he’ll pony
up all right.”</p>

<p>Tom felt a shock as though someone had
thrown cold water over him.</p>

<p>That voice!</p>

<p>Tom knew now. It was Professor Skeel.</p>

<p>He began to understand. He saw the meaning
of many things that had hitherto puzzled him.
The vagueness was clearing away. The plot was
beginning to be revealed.</p>

<p>Was this why Skeel had come to the wilderness
of the Adirondacks? Was this why he and his
cronies had been sneaking around the camp
cabins? It seemed so.</p>

<p>“And yet, what in the world can he want of
me?” Tom asked himself. “If it’s revenge for
what I did to him, this is a queer way of showing
it. I didn’t think he’d have spunk enough to plot
a thing like this, though he certainly has meanness
enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom was thinking fast. He was putting together
in his mind many matters that had seemed
strange to him. Certain it was that at Skeel’s
instigation he had been made a prisoner, and
probably with the help of Murker and Whalen,
though Tom had not seen their faces clearly and
could not be sure of their identity.</p>

<p>“But what’s it all about?” poor Tom asked
himself over and over again. “Why should he
make a prisoner of me?”</p>

<p>“Can we carry him?” asked Skeel’s voice.
“We’ve got to take him to the old shack, you
know. Can’t leave him here. Besides, there’s
some business to attend to in connection with him.
Can you carry him through the snow?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” was the answer. “He isn’t so heavy.
Up on your shoulders with him, Whalen, and
we’ll follow the professor. I’m all turned about
in this storm!”</p>

<p>Tom was sure, then, of the identity of his three
captors. He was as sure as though he had seen
them.</p>

<p>A moment later he found himself being lifted
up, and he could feel that the men were adjusting
him to their shoulders. It was no easy task, for
Tom was rather heavy, and his clothing, for he
was dressed warmly for the cold, made an additional
burden. But the men were strong, it
seemed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shall we take that off?” asked one of the
men. Tom had an idea he referred to the head-covering
bag.</p>

<p>“No, better leave it on until we get farther
off. Some of the others might see him,” was
Skeel’s answer. Tom felt sure he referred to
the bag.</p>

<p>“I wish they’d take this gag out of my mouth,”
Tom mused. “I don’t care so much for the bag.
But my tongue will feel like a piece of leather in
a little while.”</p>

<p>On through the storm Tom was carried, on the
shoulders of the two men. In fancy he could see
the former instructor leading the way.</p>

<p>“He spoke of the old shack,” mused Tom. “I
wonder if he means the deserted cabin where we
were? If he takes me there, the boys will have
a better chance of finding me if they look.”</p>

<p>But Tom was soon to know that it was not to
the deserted hut he was being carried. For the
journey soon came to an abrupt termination. The
young prisoner felt himself being carried into
some building, for he was lowered from the men’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>“They never could have reached the old cabin
in this time,” Tom decided to himself. “They
must have brought me to some new place. I
wonder what will happen now?”</p>

<p>Tom felt himself laid on some sort of bed or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
bunk. Then he heard a door closed and locked.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got him just where we want
him,” said Skeel. “Now we’ll go ahead with our
plans.”</p>

<p>And the prisoner wondered what those plans
were.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>SKEEL REVEALS HIMSELF</small></h2>


<p>“Shall we loosen him up now?” asked the
voice of one of the men. Tom could still see
nothing, as the bag remained over his head.</p>

<p>“Yes, take off the headgear, and ungag him,”
answered Skeel. “It won’t matter if he does
holler up here. No one will hear him. But keep
his hands tied, except when we feed him.”</p>

<p>Tom felt a sudden sense of elation in spite of
his most uncomfortable position. At least he was
going to get something to eat, and he needed it,
for he felt nearly famished.</p>

<p>“Is the door locked?” asked one of the men.</p>

<p>“I attended to that,” was Skeel’s answer. “He
can’t get away from here.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” mused Tom. “I’ll
have a good try, at any rate, the first chance I
get.”</p>

<p>He felt the fastenings of the bag being loosed,
and when it was taken off, he looked about him
quickly. The first glance was enough to tell him,
if he had not already been sure of it, that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
in some shack where he had never been before.
This was not the deserted cabin where he and his
chums had spent the night. Tom glanced toward
the windows, hoping to get a glimpse outside so
he might determine his position, but there were
dirty curtains over the casements.</p>

<p>His next glances were directed toward the men
themselves, though he was already sure, in his
own mind, who they were. Nor was his judgment
reversed.</p>

<p>There stood Skeel, a grin of triumph in his
ugly face, and there were the two other men, of
evil countenance, whom Tom had seen with the
erstwhile professor.</p>

<p>“We’re going to take the gag out of your
mouth,” said Skeel to his prisoner. “We don’t
want to hurt you any more than we have to, but
we’re going to have you do as we say, and not
as you want to. You can yell, if you like, but
you’ll only be wasting your breath. This is a
good way from nowhere, up here, and you won’t
be heard. You can’t get away, because one of
us will be on guard all the while. I tell you this
to save you trouble, for I know you, and I know
that you’ll make a row if you possibly can,” and
Skeel stuck out his jaw pugnaciously. He and
Tom Fairfield had been in more than one “row”
before.</p>

<p>“Take it off, Murker,” the former instructor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
said to the worse-looking of his two helpers.
“Let’s see if he’ll yelp now.”</p>

<p>It was a relief to Tom to have the bunch of
not overly-clean rags taken from his mouth. His
tongue and jaws ached from the pressure and
now he sighed in relief.</p>

<p>Tom Fairfield was not foolish. He had already
made up his mind to do all he could to
circumvent the plans of the plotters, and he was
going to begin as soon as possible. He did not
altogether believe Skeel when the latter said that
shouting would do no good, but Tom did not
intend to try, at once, that method of getting
help.</p>

<p>He wanted to rest his throat from the strain,
and he wanted to see how best to direct his voice
in case he did feel like shouting. He had no
doubt but what if he cried out for help now, the
gag would be put back in his mouth. And that
he did not want. He wanted to eat, and oh! how
he did long for a drink of cold water.</p>

<p>“Guess he isn’t going to yap,” murmured the
man known as Murker.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” said Skeel. “Now you
can loosen those ropes on his legs. He can’t
get away.”</p>

<p>Tom wished, with all his heart, that they would
loosen the bonds on his hands and arms, but he
stubbornly resolved to stand the pain those cords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
gave him, rather than ask a favor of any of the
trio of scoundrels.</p>

<p>He simply could not endure his thirst and hunger
any longer. He tried to speak&mdash;to ask at
least for a glass of water, for the men could not
be so altogether heartless as to refuse what they
would give to a dumb beast. But Tom’s throat
was so parched and dry that only a husky sound
came forth.</p>

<p>“Guess he wants to wet his whistle,” suggested
Whalen.</p>

<p>“Well, get him a drink then,” half-growled
Skeel. “Then we’ll talk business.”</p>

<p>Tom thought nothing ever tasted so good as
that draught of water from the cracked teacup
one of the men brought in from another room,
and held up to his lips. It was better than nectar
ever could be, he was sure.</p>

<p>“How about a little grub?” asked Murker.</p>

<p>“Oh, he could have it, I guess,” Skeel replied.
“Guess they didn’t any of ’em have much. They
were away from their camp all night, you say,
and there wasn’t anything in the old shanty.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented Whalen.</p>

<p>Then Tom realized that he and his companions
had been spied upon, just as Jack had so strangely
suspected. They had also been followed, it was
evident, for the men knew of the movements of
himself and his chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“I meant grub for all of us,” went on Murker.
“I’m a bit hungry myself, and it’s about time for
dinner.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;get what you want,” assented
Skeel. “And give him some. One of you can
sit by him, and take off the ropes while he eats.
But watch him&mdash;he’s like a cat&mdash;quick!”</p>

<p>Tom felt like smiling at this tribute to his
prowess, but he refrained. It was no time for
laughter.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a bit of writing to do,” Skeel went
on. “You fellows can eat if you like. I’ll take
mine later.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Whalen. “But what
about&mdash;well, you know what I mean,” and he
rubbed his fingers together to indicate money.</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to that,” said Skeel, a bit stiffly.
“You mind your own affairs!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no offense!” said Whalen, quickly. “I
only wanted to know.”</p>

<p>“You’ll know soon enough,” was the retort, as
the former teacher moved toward another room.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m in on this too. Don’t forget that!”
exclaimed Murker, and there seemed to be menace
in his tones.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother me!” answered Skeel, apparently
a bit irritated.</p>

<p>Evidently the feeling among the conspirators
was not as friendly as it might have been. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
was very like a dissention, and Tom wondered if
the truth of the old adage was to be proved,
“When thieves fall out, honest men get their
dues.”</p>

<p>“I hope it proves so in my case,” Tom reflected.
“But first I would like something to eat.
And I wish the others had some, too. I wonder
where they are now, and what they think of me?”
Professor Skeel went into another room, and
closed the door after him. Murker also went into
another apartment&mdash;there seemed to be three
rooms, at least, on the first floor of the cabin&mdash;and
presently the evil-faced man came back with
a platter on which were some chunks of cold
meat and bread. It looked better to Tom, half
famished as he was, than a banquet would have
seemed&mdash;even a surreptitious midnight school-feed.</p>

<p>“Help yourself,” growled Murker, as he set
the platter down in front of Tom, on a rough
table, and loosed the bonds of our hero’s arms.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll have a bit myself,” murmured
Whalen.</p>

<p>“Go on,” mumbled Murker, his mouth half
full. “The boss will eat later, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Tom reflected that by the “boss” they must
mean Skeel.</p>

<p>As for the young hunter, he eagerly took some
of the bread and meat. It was cold, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
good and nourishing, and seemed to have been
well cooked. It put new life into Tom at once.
He would have liked a cup of coffee, but there
seemed to be none. Perhaps the men would make
some later. Tom certainly hoped that they would
do so.</p>

<p>The men ate fast&mdash;almost ravenously, and
Tom was not at all slow himself. He did not
realize what an appetite he had until he saw the
victuals disappearing.</p>

<p>Then, when the edge of his hunger had been
a little dulled and blunted, to say the least, Tom
once more began wondering why he had been
caught and brought as a prisoner to the lonely
hut.</p>

<p>“What’s the game?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>He was soon to know.</p>

<p>“Well, if you fellows have had enough, and
he’s been fed, tie up his hands again,” said Skeel,
coming from the room just then. “I want to
have a talk with him. You can wait outside,” he
added, when the ropes had once more been put on
Tom’s hands and arms.</p>

<p>Skeel waited until the men had left the hut.
Then, locking the door after them, the former
teacher confronted Tom. Up to now our hero
had said nothing. He believed in a policy of
silence for the time being.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of yourself now?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
sneered Skeel, folding his arms. “You’re not so
smart as you thought you were, are you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t begun to think yet,” said Tom,
coolly. “But I would like to know why you
have brought me here&mdash;by what right?”</p>

<p>“By the right of&mdash;might!” was the answer.
“I’ve got you here, and here I’m going to keep
you until your father pays me a ransom of ten
thousand dollars. That will square accounts a
little, and make up for some of the things you
did to me. It’s you against ten thousand dollars,
and I guess your father would rather pay up
than see you suffer. Now I’ll get down to business,”
and he drew up a chair and sat down in
front of Tom.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>AN ANXIOUS SEARCH</small></h2>


<p>George Abbot had the luck of finding the road
for which he and his chums had all vainly sought
so long in the storm. It will be remembered that
the four boys had started in different directions,
corresponding to the different points of the compass,
to search for a route, either back to the hut
where they had spent the night, or to one of the
three camps.</p>

<p>And it was George who found the road.</p>

<p>True he did not know which road it was at the
time, but when he had stumbled on through the
drifting snow, fighting his way against the storm
for some time, he fairly tumbled down a little
embankment, rolling over and over.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s this?” George asked himself,
rather dazed, as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>He had his answer in a moment.</p>

<p>“It’s a road&mdash;I hope it’s <em>the</em> road,” he went
on, as he saw that the little declivity down which
he had fallen was where the road had been cut
through a hill, leaving a slope on either side of
the highway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must signal to the others at once,” George
decided. His gun had slipped from his grasp
when he fell, but he now picked up the weapon,
and fired two shots in quick succession. It was
the signal agreed upon.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing hard, and George was
not sure that the sound of the shots would carry
to his chums. He did not know just how far they
were from him. So, after waiting a bit, he
strolled down the snow-covered road a bit, and
fired again. He repeated this three times, at
intervals, before he heard an answering shot.
Then he raised his voice in a yell, and soon was
relieved to be joined by Jack.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Jack asked.</p>

<p>“The road&mdash;I’ve found it,” George answered.</p>

<p>“Where’s Bert&mdash;and Tom?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen either of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re probably looking yet. We’ll
fire some more shots and bring ’em up.”</p>

<p>George and Jack fired at intervals, the signal
each time being two rapid shots, but it was some
time before they had an answer. It finally came
in the shape of another shot, followed quickly by
a shout.</p>

<p>“It’s Bert,” said George.</p>

<p>“Sounded more like Tom,” was his chum’s
guess. While they waited, they exchanged experiences.
Jack told of vainly floundering about in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the drifts, while George had better news to impart.</p>

<p>“I fairly stumbled on the road,” he said.</p>

<p>“Any way at all, as long as you found it,” said
Jack. “Here comes someone now.”</p>

<p>It proved to be Bert, who staggered up through
the storm, himself almost a living snowball.</p>

<p>“Found anything?” he gasped, for he was
quite “winded.”</p>

<p>“The road,” answered George.</p>

<p>“Where’s Tom?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t he with you?” asked Bert, in
some surprise. “I haven’t seen anything of him.”</p>

<p>“He’s probably off searching for a highway,”
said George, hopefully. “We’ll fire a few more
shots.”</p>

<p>They fired more than a few, but received no
response from Tom, and we well know the reason
why, though his chums did not at the time.</p>

<p>“Well, what had we better do?” asked Jack,
at length. “I’m about all in, and I guess you
fellows feel about the same.”</p>

<p>“I would like something to eat,” admitted
Bert.</p>

<p>“And I’m terribly cold,” confessed George,
who was shivering.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s look about a bit on either side of
this road, then go up and down it a ways, and
keep firing and shouting,” suggested Jack. “We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
may find Tom. If we don’t&mdash;well, I think we’d
better see where this road goes.”</p>

<p>They adopted that plan, but though they
shouted vigorously, and fired many shots, there
came no answer from Tom.</p>

<p>The exercise and the shouting, however, had
one good result. It warmed George so he was
no longer in danger of coming down with pneumonia.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s six of one and a half dozen of the
other,” said Bert, at length. “What shall we do,
and which way shall we go on this road to get to
camp?”</p>

<p>“We’d better try to find one of the cabins,”
said Jack. “And I think this direction seems to
be the most likely,” and he pointed to the left.</p>

<p>“Go ahead; I’m with you,” said Bert, and
George nodded assent.</p>

<p>“What about Tom, though?” asked George,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t find him. He may have gone
on ahead, or he may still be searching for a road.
In either case he’s too far off for us to make
him hear&mdash;that’s evident. And we may find him
just as well by trying to make our way back to
camp as staying here,” said Jack.</p>

<p>So it was decided to do this, and off they started.
The storm did not seem quite so fierce now. In
fact, there were indications that the fall of snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was lessening. But a great deal had fallen, making
walking difficult. The cold was intense, but
it was a dry cold, not like the damp, penetrating
air of New Jersey, and the boys stood it much
better.</p>

<p>They had not gone far before Jack uttered a
cry.</p>

<p>“Here he comes! There’s Tom!” he shouted,
pointing at a figure advancing toward them
through the mist of flakes that were still falling,
but more lazily now.</p>

<p>“It’s someone, but how do you know it’s
Tom?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Who else would it be?” Jack wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“It might be&mdash;Skeel,” suggested George.</p>

<p>“Or that&mdash;bear!” and, as he said this, Bert
advanced his gun.</p>

<p>“Nonsense&mdash;that’s no bear!” exclaimed Jack.
“It isn’t Tom though, either,” he added, as the
figure came nearer.</p>

<p>A moment later they all saw at once who it was.</p>

<p>“Sam Wilson!” exclaimed Bert. “That’s
good! Now he can tell us what to do, and where
Tom is. Hello, Sam!” he called, for that was
how everyone addressed the genial guide&mdash;even
those who had met him only once or twice.</p>

<p>“Hello yourselves!” Sam answered in greeting.
“What are you fellows doing here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve been lost, and we’ve just found ourselves,”
explained Jack. “We’re on our way to
Camp No. 3.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you’re not!” exclaimed Sam, smiling.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Bert wanted to know.</p>

<p>“For the simple reason that you’re on your
way to Camp No. 2,” answered Sam. “You’re
going the wrong way for Camp No. 3.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we are twisted,” admitted Jack,
“but as long as we’re headed for some camp, I
don’t care what it is.</p>

<p>“We’ve been out all night,” he added, “or at
least sheltered in only an old cabin. We haven’t
had anything to-day but some coffee, and we’re
about done out. Isn’t this storm fierce?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re used to these up here in the Adirondacks,”
spoke Sam.</p>

<p>Then the boys told how they had been out
hunting and had seen the signpost that informed
them it was seven miles to Ramsen.</p>

<p>“But you went the wrong way!” exclaimed
Sam, when he had heard the details. “Ramsen
was in just the opposite direction.”</p>

<p>“Then the signboard was wrong!” declared
Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” Sam spoke, musingly. “Signboards
don’t change themselves that way. There’s
something wrong here.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind that,” went on Bert.
“Have you seen anything of Tom Fairfield?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tom Fairfield! Why, I thought he was with
you!” exclaimed Sam, quickly looking around.</p>

<p>“He was, but we separated to find the road,”
explained George, “and now we can’t locate
Tom.”</p>

<p>“Well, this won’t do,” Sam spoke, and his
voice was serious. “We will have to hunt for
him right away. He hasn’t had anything to eat,
you say?”</p>

<p>“None of us have,” said Jack. “That’s why
we were so glad to find some sort of road.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got my pung back there a piece,”
said the guide. “I have some grub in it that I
was taking over to your Camp No. 2. I can give
you a snack from that, and then we’ll do
some searching for the boy. I like Tom Fairfield!”</p>

<p>“So do I!” exclaimed Jack, and the others
nodded emphatic agreements, with a chorus of:</p>

<p>“That’s what!”</p>

<p>Never did food taste so good as that which
Sam brought up from his pung. He explained
that he had walked on ahead while his horses
were eating their dinners from nose-bags.</p>

<p>“And it’s lucky for you fellows I did,” he
said, “though of course you might have stumbled
on the camp yourselves. But now for a search.”</p>

<p>And with anxious hearts the boys took it up.
Where could Tom Fairfield be? That was a
question each one asked himself.</p>

<small>DEFIANCE</small></h2>


<p>Tom, a bound prisoner, watched the insolent
professor who sat facing him. The latter had on
his face a sneer of triumph, but mingled with it,
as Tom could note, was a look that had in it not
a little fear. For the desperate man had planned
a desperate game, and he was not altogether sure
how it would work out.</p>

<p>Tom steeled himself to meet what was coming.
He did not know what it was, but that it was
something that would concern himself, vitally, he
was sure. And he was better prepared to meet
what was coming than he had been an hour or
so previous.</p>

<p>For now, though he was a prisoner, and bound,
he was warm, and he had eaten. These things go
far toward making courage in a man, or boy
either, for that matter.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Professor Skeel, and the sneer on
his face grew more pronounced, “we’ll talk business!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we won’t!” exclaimed Tom, quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t?” and there was a sharp note in
the man’s voice.</p>

<p>“I’ll have nothing to do with you,” went on
Tom. “You brought me here against my will,
and you are liable to severe penalties for what
you did. As soon as I can get to an officer, I
intend to cause your arrest, and the arrest of
those two miserable tools of yours.</p>

<p>“I’m not at all afraid&mdash;don’t think it. You
can’t keep me here for very long. Sooner or
later I’ll get out, and then I’ll make it hot for
you! That’s just what I’ll do&mdash;I’ll make it hot
for you!”</p>

<p>During this little outburst on the part of Tom,
Professor Skeel sat staring at his prisoner. He
did not seem at all frightened by what Tom said,
though the young man put all the force he could
into his words. But Tom was observant. He
noticed that the little look of worry did not leave
the man’s face.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it so hot for you,” went on Tom,
“that you’ll have to leave this part of the country.
You’ll have to leave if you get the chance, and
perhaps you won’t. My father and I will push
this case to the end. I don’t know what your
game is, but I can guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, since you can guess, perhaps you can
guess what I’m going to do with you!” angrily
interrupted the professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I can’t, exactly,” spoke Tom, slowly,
“but if it’s anything mean or low-down, you’ll
do it. I know you of old. I’ve had dealing with
you before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you’re going to have more!” the
professor fairly shouted. “I’m going to get even
with you for what you did for me. You caused
me to lose my place at Elmwood Hall&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You deserved to lose it!” said Tom, cuttingly.</p>

<p>“And you mistreated me when we were out in
that open boat&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mistreated you!” fairly gasped Tom, amazed
at the man’s hardness of mind. “Mistreated you,
when you tried to steal the little water and food
we had left!”</p>

<p>He could say no more. His mind went back
vividly to the days of the wreck of the <i>Silver Star</i>,
when he and others had been in great peril at sea.
He had indeed prevented the professor from
carrying out his evil designs, though Tom was
not more harsh than needful. But now he was
to suffer for that.</p>

<p>“I’ve got you where I want you,” went on
Skeel, when Tom had become silent. “I’ve laid
my plans well, and you fell into the trap. I
won’t deny that the storm helped a lot, but I’ve
got you now, and you’re going to do as I say, or
it will be the worse for you. You’ll do as I
say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure!” interrupted Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s enough!” snapped the angry man.
“You may not realize that you are in my power,
and that you’re up here in a lonely part of the
woods, away from your friends. They don’t
know where you are, and you don’t know where
they are. They can’t help you. Those two men
of mine will do as I say, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve no doubt but that you’ve trained
them well in your own class of scoundrelism,”
said Tom, coolly.</p>

<p>“Silence!” fairly shouted the infuriated man.
Tom ceased his talk because he chose, not because
he was afraid.</p>

<p>Professor Skeel hesitated a moment, and then
drew from his pocket some papers. Tom was at
a loss to guess what they might be. In fact, he
had but a dim idea why he had been captured and
brought to the hut in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Some things the two men&mdash;Murker and
Whalen&mdash;let fall, however, gave him an inkling
of what was to come. So he did not show any
great surprise when Professor Skeel, handing him
a paper, said:</p>

<p>“That’s a copy of a letter I want you to write
to your father. Copy it, sign it in your natural
hand, without any changes whatever, or without
making any secret signs on the paper, and give it
back to me. When I get the right kind of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
answer back, I’ll let you go&mdash;not before. Write
that letter to your father!”</p>

<p>There was a veiled threat implied in the insolent
command.</p>

<p>Professor Skeel held the letter out in front of
Tom. The latter could not take it, of course,
for his hands were tied.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the plotter, as though he had
just wakened to this fact. “Well, I’ll loosen your
hands for you, but you must promise not to fight.
Not that I’m afraid of you, for I can master you,
but I don’t want to hurt you, physically, if I can
help it.”</p>

<p>Tom did not altogether agree with the professor
that he would be the master if it came
to an encounter. For our hero was a vigorous
lad, he played football and baseball, and his
muscles were ready for instant call. True, he was
tired from lack of rest and the hardships he had
gone through, but he was not at all afraid of a
“scrap,” as he afterward put it.</p>

<p>So, then, when Professor Skeel made the remark
about the bonds, Tom was ready for what
came next.</p>

<p>“I’ll loosen those ropes, so you can copy this
letter, if you’ll promise not to attack me,” went
on Skeel.</p>

<p>“I’ll promise nothing!” exclaimed Tom, defiantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right. Then I’ll have to call in my helpers
to stand by,” grimly went on the former instructor.
“They’ll take care of you if you cut
up rough.”</p>

<p>He went to the door, and called out:</p>

<p>“Murker&mdash;Whalen! Come in. We may need
you,” he added significantly.</p>

<p>Tom steeled himself for what was to come.</p>

<p>“Take off those ropes,” went on the professor,
when his two mean men had come in. “Then, if
he starts a row&mdash;let him have it!”</p>

<p>The words were coarse and rough, and the
man’s manner and tone even more so.</p>

<p>“Are we to take off these ropes?” asked
Murker.</p>

<p>“Yes, and then stand by. I’m going to make
him write this letter. That will bring the cash.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we want!” exclaimed Whalen,
with an unctious smile. “It’s the cash I’m after.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get none from my father!” cried Tom,
beginning to understand the course of the plot.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” muttered the professor.
“Loose his bonds, but look out! He’s a tricky
customer.”</p>

<p>“Not any more so than you are,” Tom said,
promptly. “And I want to tell you here and
now, when you have your witnesses present&mdash;mean
and low as they are&mdash;I want to tell you
that you’ll suffer for this when I get out. I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
make it my business, and my father will also, to
prosecute you to the full extent of the law!”</p>

<p>“Words&mdash;mere words!” sneered Skeel.</p>

<p>“You won’t get out until you do as the boss
wants,” said Whalen.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so rough. Better give in, it will be
easier,” spoke Murker, who seemed a little
alarmed by what Tom said.</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to him,” said Skeel curtly. “Take
off the ropes. Then you read this letter and copy
and sign it!” he ordered.</p>

<p>A moment later Tom’s hands were free. He
did not see any chance for making an escape then,
so he waited, merely stretching his arms so that
the bound muscles were more free. True, he
might have made a rush on his captors, but the
door had been locked, after the entrance of Murker
and Whalen, and Tom did not see what opportunity
he would have with three against him.
He might be seriously hurt and that would spoil
his chances for a future escape.</p>

<p>“Read that,” ordered Skeel, thrusting the paper
into Tom’s hands. A glance showed that it
was addressed to his father. It recited that Tom
was in trouble, that he had been made a prisoner
by a band of men who would release him only
on payment of ten thousand dollars. Details
were given as to how the money, in cash, must be
sent, and Mr. Fairfield was urged to make no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
effort to trace Tom, or it would result seriously
for the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Sign that and we’ll send it,” ordered Skeel.</p>

<p>Tom dropped the letter to the floor, disdaining
to hand it back.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” fairly roared the professor.
“Do you mean you won’t do as I say?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I mean,” said Tom, coolly.
“You may keep me here as long as you like, and
you can do as you please, but I’ll never sign that
letter. Go ahead! I’m not afraid of you!” and
he faced his enemies defiantly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p>Professor Skeel retained control of himself
with an obvious effort. Clearly he had expected
more of a spirit of agreement on the part of
Tom, though he might have known, from his previous
experiences with our hero, that compliance
would not be given. But Tom did not even take
the trouble to hand back the letter. It had fluttered
to the floor of the cabin.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;” began Whalen, angrily spluttering
the words.</p>

<p>“Silence!” commanded Skeel. “I’m attending
to this.” His face and his tone showed his
anger, but he managed to keep it under control.
He picked up the letter&mdash;something of a condescension
on his part, and said to Tom:</p>

<p>“Then you refuse to do as I ask?”</p>

<p>“I most certainly do! The idea is positively&mdash;silly!”
and Tom had the nerve to laugh in the
faces of his enemies.</p>

<p>“We’ll make you sweat for this!” declared
Whalen. “We’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better let the boss work the game,” suggested
Murker. In spite of his evil face, and the fact
that he was just as guilty in the matter as the
others, he seemed of a more conciliatory spirit.</p>

<p>“Yes, you keep out of this,” commanded the
professor to the former employee of the school.
“I know what I’m doing.”</p>

<p>Tom wondered what the next move would be.
He did not have to wait long to find out.</p>

<p>“Well, if you won’t sign this now, you will
later,” said Skeel, as he folded the letter and put
it into his pocket. “Take him to the dark room,”
he ordered. “Maybe he’ll come to his senses
there. And don’t give him too much bread and
water,” and the man laughed as he gave this
order. “A little starving will bring some results,
perhaps. Lock him up, and bring me the key.”</p>

<p>“All right, you’re the boss,” assented Murker.
“I’m in this thing now, and I’m going to stick it
out, but I wish&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re right; you’re going to stick!” interrupted
Skeel. “You’re in it as deep as I am, and
you can’t get out!”</p>

<p>Murker did not finish what he started to say.
He shrugged his shoulders and seemed resigned
to what was to come. Tom disliked him the least
of the three, though the man’s face was not in his
favor.</p>

<p>“Shall we tie him up again?” asked Whalen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and tie him good and tight, too. Don’t
mind how you draw those cords. The more
trouble we make now, the less we’ll have to make
later. Tie him up and put him away where he
can cool off,” and Professor Skeel laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>For an instant a desperate resolve came into
Tom’s mind to make a rush and a break for liberty.
But the idea was dismissed almost as soon
as it was formed.</p>

<p>What chance would he stand with three full-grown
men to oppose him? The door was locked,
and Tom’s feet were still bound. He had a knife
in his pocket, but to reach it, and cut the ropes
on his ankles would take time, and in that time
he would easily be overpowered by his captors.
It was out of the question now.</p>

<p>“But I’m going to escape, if it’s at all possible,”
Tom declared to himself. “And when I do get
out of here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But he could not finish his thought. His gun
and mackinaw had been taken away from him,
and now when Whalen roughly seized him, and
put the ropes on his wrists, Skeel said:</p>

<p>“Search his pockets. Take what money he has
and any sort of weapons. Then lock him up!”</p>

<p>Tom did have considerable money on him, and
this was soon out of his pockets, and in that of
the professor. Tom’s knife and other possessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
were also removed. Then he was lifted up,
carried to another room, and roughly thrust into
sort of a closet that was very dark. Tom fell
heavily to the floor. His mackinaw was tossed
in to him.</p>

<p>“He can use that for a blanket&mdash;we’re short of
covering,” he heard Skeel say. “We don’t want
him to be too comfortable, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Tom was anything but at his ease just then,
but he did not falter in his determination not to
give in. He shut his teeth grimly.</p>

<p>The door was closed and locked, and our hero
was left to his not very pleasant reflections. He
managed to struggle to a sitting position, and to
edge over until he was leaning back against the
wall. He drew his heavy mackinaw to him. It
would be warm during the cold night, for that
he would be kept a prisoner at least that length
of time, he could not doubt.</p>

<p>Tom’s thoughts were many and various. So
this was why Skeel had followed him and his
chums. This was why he had reappeared at Elmwood
Hall, and had caused Whalen to ask questions
about the hunting trip.</p>

<p>So this was Skeel’s plan for enriching his purse
and at the same time getting revenge. So far,
fate had played into the hands of the unscrupulous
man and his confederates.</p>

<p>“But I’ll get away!” Tom told himself. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
sat there in the gloomy darkness, trying to think
of a plan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his chums, with Sam Wilson, were
frantically searching for him in the storm. Sam’s
idea was not to leave the neighborhood where
Tom had last been seen, until they had exhausted
every effort to locate their missing chum.</p>

<p>But it was difficult to search in the storm, and
the whirl of flakes made a long view impossible.
Then, too, they were in a dense part of the wilderness.
Sam Wilson’s farm was perhaps the
largest cleared part of it, though here and there
were patches where trees had been cut down.</p>

<p>Up and down the road, and on either side of
it, the search went on. Sam Wilson was a born
woodsman, as well as a hunter and farmer, and
he brought his efficiency to the task.</p>

<p>“But it seems to be no go, boys,” he said, at
length.</p>

<p>“But what has become of him?” asked George
with a look of worriment on his face.</p>

<p>“That’s what we can’t say except that he’s
lost,” spoke Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, but lost in this wilderness&mdash;in this
storm,” added Bert. “It’s dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what it is, provided he is still
lost,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“Still lost! What do you mean?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mean he may have gone so far that he found
his way back to one of the camps.”</p>

<p>“Really?” hopefully cried Bert, who thought
Sam might be saying that simply to cheer them
up.</p>

<p>“Why, of course it’s possible,” the caretaker
went on. “He may have gone on beyond the
sound of your guns. And, unexpectedly, he may
have hit the trail to one of the camps. For there
are trails that lead through the woods. They’re
not easy to find, or follow, but Tom might have
had luck.”</p>

<p>“Then what shall we do?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Go back to Camp No. 2,” answered Sam.
“Tom may be there. If he isn’t, we’ll go to the
others in turn. Let’s go back. We’ll drive.”</p>

<p>So, abandoning the search for the time being,
they started back for camp in the pung, drawn
by the powerful horses. They were hoping
against hope that Tom would be there, or that
they would find him at one of the other cabins.</p>

<p>But Tom was still a prisoner in the dark closet
of the lonely shack. What his thoughts were you
can well imagine, but, above everything else stood
out the determination not to give in and sign the
letter asking for the ransom money.</p>

<p>Hours passed. Tom again felt the pangs of
hunger. He had an idea the men might try to
starve him, but after an interval, which he imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
brought the time to noon, Murker came in
with some bread and water.</p>

<p>“Boss’s orders,” he growled. “I’ll untie your
hands while you eat, and don’t try any tricks.”</p>

<p>Tom did not answer. The bread was welcome,
but the water more so. Murker left him a glass
full after he had once emptied the tumbler. Then
the ropes were again put on his hands, and he
was left alone in the darkness.</p>

<p>Whether it was the same day or not, Tom
could hardly tell. He must have dozed, for
he awoke with a start, and he knew at once that
some noise had caused it.</p>

<p>He listened intently, and heard a scratching,
sniffing sound back of him. He could feel the
board side of the shack, against which he was
leaning, vibrate.</p>

<p>“Can it be that the boys are trying to release
me?” Tom asked himself. But in another moment
he knew this could not be true. His chums
would come boldly up and not try to get him out
in this secret fashion. The scratching and sniffing
increased.</p>

<p>“It’s some animal!” Tom decided. He edged
away from the side of the closet-room, and waited.
The sound increased. Then came a splintering,
rending sound as of wood breaking. Tom fancied
he could feel a board move.</p>

<p>An instant later a streak of light came suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
into his prison. It was from the moon which was
shining brightly on the snow outside, and by the
light through the crack Tom could see a big hairy
paw thrust in where the board had been torn off.</p>

<p>“It’s a bear!” cried the lad. “He must smell
something to eat, and he’s trying to get after it.
He’s standing outside and has pulled off a loose
board, and&mdash;by Jove! I can get out that way!”
he said aloud. As he spoke the board was pulled
farther loose, leaving a large opening. A sniffing
snout was thrust in. Tom had no intention of
sharing his prison with a bear, and, raising his
two bound feet Tom kicked the animal on its
most tender place&mdash;the nose. With a growl
Bruin withdrew, and Tom could hear him sniffing
indignantly as he scampered over the snow. But
the bear had made for Tom a way of escape.</p>

<p>“If I could only get my arms and legs free, I
could squeeze out through that opening,” Tom
decided. Then like a flash the plan came to him.</p>

<p>The tumbler of water had been left within
reach. Tom kicked it over with sufficient force
to break the glass. He had to make a noise, but
after waiting a while, he felt sure his captors had
not been aroused. They did not seem to be on
guard, or they would have heard the bear when
he pulled loose the outside board.</p>

<p>Tom’s muscles were in good control, but he
had to strain himself unmercifully to bend over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and get a piece of the broken glass between his
hands. Then he put it between his two boots,
and held it there, with a sharp edge up, by pressing
his feet tightly together.</p>

<p>You have doubtless guessed his plan. He was
going to use the glass as a knife and saw the rope
of his wrists upon it. This he proceeded to do.
The moonlight outside, streaming in, gave him
enough illumination to work by.</p>

<p>He cut himself several times before he succeeded
in fraying the rope enough so it could be
broken. Then, rubbing his arms to restore the
interrupted circulation, Tom used the glass on
the rope that bound his ankles. This he cut
through quickly enough, and, was able to stand
up. His legs were weak, and he waited a few
minutes until he could use them to better advantage.
Then, forcing farther off the dangling
board, Tom crawled out in the snow, putting on
his mackinaw when he was outside.</p>

<p>The storm had ceased. It was night&mdash;a night
with a dazzling moon, and Tom was free. But
where his chums were, or in what direction the
camp lay, he could not tell.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>THE SHOT</small></h2>


<p>For a moment, after getting outside the cabin,
Tom hardly knew what to do. He was at a loss
in which direction to start, but he realized the
necessity of getting away from that vicinity as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>Though his escape did not seem to have
aroused his captors, there was no telling when
they would take the alarm and start after him.
Tom looked for the bear. The animal was not
in sight, though he could see by marks in the
snow, where it had approached the cabin from
the woods, and where it had run off into the
forest again.</p>

<p>“Too bad I haven’t my gun!” mused Tom.
“But I don’t dare try to get it.”</p>

<p>Then began for Tom a time he never forgot.
He set off toward the woods, wishing to gain
their friendly shelter as soon as he could, but
once there he was at a loss how farther to proceed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“But there’s no need to wait for morning,”
he reasoned. “I can see almost as well now, as
long as the moon is up. I’ll try to find some
sort of a trail.”</p>

<p>He staggered on, yes, staggered, for he was
weak from his experience, and he had not had
proper food in some time. It seemed almost a
week, but of course it was not as long as that.</p>

<p>Scarcely able to walk, but grimly determined
not to give up, Tom urged himself on. Whither
he was going, he knew not, but any way to leave
that hateful shack, and the more hateful men
behind, was good enough for the time being.</p>

<p>All night long Tom kept on going. He fancied
he was on some sort of trail or road, but he could
not be sure. Certainly the trees seemed cut down
in a line, though it was a twisting and turning
one.</p>

<p>Then the moon went down, leaving the scene
pretty dark, but the white snow made objects
plain. Tom kept on until at last he was fairly
staggering from side to side. He was very weak.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ve got to give up,” he panted. “I&mdash;I’ve
got to&mdash;to rest.”</p>

<p>He looked about and saw sort of a nook under
some bushes. On top was a matting of snow, like
a roof. Tom crawled into this like some hunted
animal, and sank down wearily. He pulled his
mackinaw about him, thankful that he had it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
him. He must have frozen without its protection.</p>

<p>Again Tom was unaware of the passage of
time. He must have dozed or fainted, perhaps,
but when he opened his eyes the sun was shining.
The day was a brilliant one, and warm, for that
time of year. Tom took heart. He crawled out,
and once more started on his wearying tramp.
He was very weak and exhausted, and there was
a “gone” feeling to his stomach.</p>

<p>“Or the place where it used to be,” Tom said,
with grim humor. “I don’t believe I have a
stomach left.”</p>

<p>But he forced himself onward. It seemed that
he had been staggering over the snow for a week.
Time had lost its meaning for him.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I only had something to eat! If I
only could find the camp!” murmured poor Tom.</p>

<p>He reached a stump, and sat down on it to rest.
He closed his eyes but suddenly opened them
again.</p>

<p>Was that fancy, or had he heard a shot? He
leaped up, electrified, and then hesitated. Perhaps
it was Skeel and the others after him. But
a quick look across the snow showed him no one
was in sight. Tom reasoned quickly.</p>

<p>“Skeel and his crowd wouldn’t shoot unless
they saw me, and then it would be to scare me.
It can’t have been those men who fired. It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
be the boys. But where are they?” Tom looked
eagerly about.</p>

<p>Again came the shot. There was no mistake
this time. Then Tom heard a shout. He tried
to answer it, but his voice was too weak. Another
shot cracked on the frosty air, and then
came a series of confused calls.</p>

<p>“There he is!”</p>

<p>“We’ve found him!”</p>

<p>“Hurry up!”</p>

<p>A mist dimmed Tom’s vision. He cleared his
eyes with a quick motion of his hand, and then
he saw his three chums and Sam Wilson rushing
toward him. They came out of the woods, and,
a moment later, had surrounded him.</p>

<p>“Where were you?”</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“Where’s your gun?”</p>

<p>“You look all in!”</p>

<p>Fast came the questions.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I am all in,” Tom faltered. “It’s that
rascal Skeel. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He could not go on for a moment. Then he
pulled himself together.</p>

<p>“Here! Drink this!” exclaimed Jack, producing
a small vacuum bottle. “It’s coffee and it’s
hot yet.” He poured some out into a tin cup and
Tom drank it. It revived him at once. Then,
with a little more of the beverage, and a hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
swallowing of a sandwich which formed part of
the emergency lunch the boys had brought with
them, Tom was able to tell his story.</p>

<p>Hot indignation was expressed by all, and then
Jack related how they had found the road, but
lost Tom, and how they had met with Sam. Their
trip to Camp No. 2 had been fruitless, as we
know, nor were they any more successful when
they came to Camp No. 3. Tom was not there.
Then they started for Camp No. 1, and were on
their way thither when they came upon the object
of their search. On the way they shouted and
fired signal guns at intervals. The dog had
found his way to Camp No. 1, after leaving Tom,
but the animal could not lead Tom’s friends to
him.</p>

<p>“And now to make it hot for those scoundrels!”
exclaimed Sam. “We’ll prosecute them
not only for kidnapping and robbing you, for
that’s what they did when they took your gun
and money, but we’ll bring an action in trespass
against them. That shack where they kept you
belongs to the hunting club.”</p>

<p>“And to think Tom was there all the while
and we never knew it,” said Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, I intended to have a look there, if we
hadn’t found him at Cabin No. 1,” declared Sam.
“But now let’s get busy! Can you walk, Tom,
or will you wait here until I can go get a horse?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be all right soon. I was just weak
from hunger.”</p>

<p>Soon Tom was able to proceed. They were
about half way between Camp No. 1 and the
shack where our hero had been kept a prisoner,
and it was decided to go to the latter place and
make an endeavor to capture Skeel and his
cronies.</p>

<p>But our friends were too late. The kidnappers
had fled, but Tom’s gun and all his possessions,
save his money, were found in the cabin. Doubtless
the personal belongings were too conclusive
evidence against the plotters, to risk taking, but
someone had succumbed to the temptation of the
cash.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to get this back,” Tom said,
taking up his gun.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll get those rascals yet!” declared
Sam. “I’ll rouse the whole country after
them!”</p>

<p>They went on to Camp No. 1 and there Tom
had a good rest. It did not take long to pull
himself together, and he was as eager as the
others to start out on the trail of the scoundrels.
For the time being hunting and the taking of
photographs was forgotten. Sam sent word to
the authorities, and a sheriff’s posse was organized.
It was done so quickly that Skeel and the
others, who had taken the alarm and fled when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
they discovered Tom’s escape, were apprehended
before they could leave the neighborhood. The
heavy storms had blocked the railroad and there
were no trains. The men could not hire a sled
and team and so were forced to walk, which put
them at a disadvantage. They left a trail easy
for the woodsmen, hunters and trappers to follow.</p>

<p>“Well, you got us, and you got us good!”
said Murker, when they were arrested and confronted
by Tom and the others. “I was afraid
something like this would happen.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so, then, and keep me
out of it?” asked Whalen, sullenly.</p>

<p>Professor Skeel said nothing, but he scowled at
Tom. The plotter’s plans had fallen through,
and he faced a long prison term, which, in due
course he received, as did his confederates. The
letter Skeel had tried to force Tom to write was
found on the man and made conclusive evidence
against him and the others. So the scoundrel-professor
was cheated of his revenge and the
money he hoped to get from Mr. Fairfield.</p>

<p>It became known that Professor Skeel had various
experiences after Tom had last seen him.
The man was in desperate circumstances when
he formed a plan of kidnapping Tom, and holding
him for ransom. It was a foolish and risky plan,
but Skeel talked it over with his two cronies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
decided to try it. They knew Mr. Fairfield was
rich.</p>

<p>Then came Skeel’s trip to Elmwood Hall. The
snowball was an accident he had not counted on,
and it made him more angry than ever against
Tom.</p>

<p>Professor Skeel’s injured ear, which looked, as
Sam said, “like it had been chawed by some
critter,” was the result of a fight he had with a
man before this story opened, and with which
we have nothing to do. Sufficient to say that it
served to identify the man, and put our friends
on their guard, so that justice was finally meted
out.</p>

<p>The trial and conviction of the men came later.
After the trio were safely locked in jail, Tom and
his chums returned to the woods where they had
been lost. But they were better acquainted with
the forest now.</p>

<p>“And we’ll have some fine hunting!” cried
Tom, now himself again.</p>

<p>“And get some photographs!” added Bert.
“I want a view of that hut where the bear pulled
the board off so you could get out.”</p>

<p>“That was queer,” said Tom, smiling. “I
don’t believe I’ll like to shoot a bear now, after
that one did me such a good turn.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have much chance,” Sam said.
“I guess even the oldest and toughest bear is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
‘holed-up’ by now. Better be content with
deer!”</p>

<p>And the boys had to be, rather against their
wills. But they were made happy when each one
got a specimen, though none was as fine as was
Tom’s antlered head. Moreover, Bert and the
others secured all the photographs they wanted.</p>

<p>But deer was not the only game they shot.</p>

<p>Rabbits, partridges and squirrels were plentiful,
and the boys had more than enough for their
meals. They enjoyed to the utmost the holiday
time spent in the hunting camps, and Tom paid
his first visit to Camp No. 3.</p>

<p>“Well, take it all in all, how did you enjoy it,
fellows?” asked Tom, when, after a last successful
hunt they were preparing to go back to home
and Elmwood Hall.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t have been better!” was the enthusiastic
answer from all.</p>

<p>“But it was rather tough on you, Tom,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mind it so much, except the
‘hunger-strike’ I had to go on, after I escaped,”
was the reply. “And I had the satisfaction of
besting Skeel.”</p>

<p>“He’ll hate you worse than ever,” commented
Bert.</p>

<p>“He’ll be a long while getting out,” Tom said.
“That’s one consolation. Well, here comes Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
with the pung. I suppose we’ve got to go back!”</p>

<p>And with sighs of regret at what they were
leaving, real regret in spite of the hardships, the
boys prepared to return to civilization, at which
point we will take leave of them.</p>
